# Algolia Search

## Environment variables

There are 3 environment variables required:

- NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX

These are required to access the Algolia API and fetch the necessary information.

## How to prepare and index information

The file with the indexes for Algolia can be generated by running:

`pnpm index:docs`

This will generate `algolia.json` at the root of the project, which can be uploaded to Algolia to create the indexes.

Searchable attributes on Algolia should be set to:

- title (ordered)
- description (ordered)
- content (unordered)

Deduplication and Grouping should be set to:

- Distinct: `true`
- Attribute for Distinct: `section`
