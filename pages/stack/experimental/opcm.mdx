# OP Contracts Manager

The OP Contracts Manager is a contract that deploys the L1 contracts for an OP Stack chain in a single transaction. It provides a minimal set of user-configurable parameters to ensure that the resulting chain meets the standard configuration requirements.

The version deployed is always a governance-approved contract release. The set of governance approved contract releases can be found on the Optimism Monorepo releases page, and is the set of releases named `op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`.

## Problem statement

The current L2 chain deployment approach originates from a time with Hardhat, single L1 target, and a single monolithic set of features. Since then the system has migrated to Foundry and extended for more features, but remains centered around a single monolithic deploy-config for all its features.

The interop team needs a way to configure new multi-L2 deployments: The number of ways to compose L2s in tests grows past what a single legacy config template can support.

Outside of interop, deployment also seems increasingly complex and opaque, while it does not have to be, due to the same configuration and composability troubles.

## Purpose 

OPCM simplifies the L1 contract deployments for new OP Stack chains. It addresses three aspects of deploying the OP Stack's L1 contracts:

1.   **Deploy Superchain Contracts.** Superchain contracts are shared between many OP chains, so this occurs only occasionally in production, but is needed for every OP chain deployment in devnet and testnet.
1.   **Deploy Shared Implementation Contracts.** This occurs once per contracts release in production, but is needed for every OP chain deployment in devnet and testnet.
1.   **Deploy OP Chain Contracts.** This occurs for every OP chain deployment in production, devnet, and testnet.

In a future iteration, it also is meant to handle upgrading the smart contracts.
