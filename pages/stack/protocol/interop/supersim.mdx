# SuperSim Explainer

[SuperSim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim) is a local development environment tool designed to simulate the Optimism Superchain for developers building multi-chain applications. It provides a simplified way to test and develop applications that interact with multiple chains within the Superchain ecosystem.

## SuperSim Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Smart Contracts] --> B[Deploy on SuperSim]
    B --> C[Test Cross-Chain Interactions]
    C --> D[Debug and Refine]
    D --> B
    C --> E[Ready for Production]
```

This diagram illustrates the typical workflow for developers using SuperSim, from writing smart contracts to testing and refining cross-chain interactions.

## Features and Benefits

*   Simulates multiple OP Stack chains locally (e.g., chain 901, 902)
*   Supports testing of cross-chain messaging and interactions
*   Includes pre-deployed interoperability contracts
*   Offers a CLI interface for starting and managing SuperSim instances
*   Provides JSON-RPC endpoints for each simulated chain
*   Allows for custom configuration of chain parameters
*   Facilitates testing of Superchain-specific features like SupERC20 tokens
*   Integration with common Ethereum development tools (e.g., Hardhat, Foundry)

## SuperSim CLI Interaction

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer] --> B[SuperSim CLI]
    B --> C[Chain 901]
    B --> D[Chain 902]
    B --> E[...]
    C --> F[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
    D --> G[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
    E --> H[JSON-RPC Endpoint]
    I[Pre-deployed Interoperability Contracts] --> C
    I --> D
    I --> E
```

This diagram illustrates how developers interact with SuperSim through the CLI, which then manages multiple simulated chains, each with its own JSON-RPC endpoint and pre-deployed interoperability contracts.
