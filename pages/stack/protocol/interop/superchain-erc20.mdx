# SuperchainERC20 Token Standard

<Callout>
  Interop is currently in active development and not yet ready for production use. The information provided here may change. Check back regularly for the most up-to-date information.

`SuperchainERC20` is a token standard specifically designed for the Superchain ecosystem. It serves as the foundation for interoperable tokens within the Superchain, including `GovToken`, `WETH` (Wrapped Ether), and migrated `OptimismMintableERC20Tokens`. This standard is crucial for enabling a more interconnected and efficient token ecosystem within the Superchain, balancing the needs for interoperability, security, and simplified governance.

## Features and benefits

*   **Interoperability**: Enables seamless token transfers between different chains within the Superchain ecosystem.
*   **Built-in bridging**: The bridging interface exists on the token itself, eliminating the need for a central bridge predeploy (e.g., `bridgeERC20`, `bridgeERC20To`).
*   **Consistency**: Provides a unified standard for tokens across all Superchain-compatible networks.
*   **Governance minimized**: Designed to keep tokens within the Superchain ecosystem with minimal governance intervention.
*   **Superchain-specific**: Tailored for internal use cases within the Superchain, addressing specific needs that other standards may not cover.

## Major components

*   **Token Contract**: implements the `SuperchainERC20` standard with bridging functionality.
*   **Factory Predeploy**: uses a `create3`-based factory for deploying `SuperchainERC20` tokens consistently across chains.
*   **Bridging Functions**: using methods like `bridgeERC20` and `bridgeERC20To` for cross-chain transfers.
*   **Minting Role**: modifies the definition to be minting role-based rather than interface-based.

## Comparison to other standards

`SuperchainERC20` differs from other token standards in its focus and implementation:

*   `SuperchainERC20` is tailored for the Superchain, while other token standards might aim for broader cross-chain compatibility.
*   `SuperchainERC20` is governance-minimized and designed to keep tokens within the Superchain ecosystem.
*   The bridging functionality in `SuperchainERC20` is part of the token itself, not relying on external bridges.

  Projects moving from other token standards may need to adapt to the `SuperchainERC20` specification.

## Implementation details

Application developers must complete two tasks to enable `SuperchainERC20`. This advance setup ensures that `SuperchainERC20` goes live when the interop upgrade happens and your token becomes interoperable.

1.  Deployment at same address on each chain using `create2` function
2.  Permission `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` to the Superchain bridge address

For now, application developers should view `SuperchainERC20`as standard ERC20 tokens with additional built-in functions that will be enabled once interop goes live.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `SuperchainERC20` token must give access to the address where the future interop bridge will live.
