# SuperchainERC20 Token Standard

<Callout>
  Interop is currently in active development and not yet ready for production use. The information provided here may change. Check back regularly for the most up-to-date information.
</Callout>

`SuperchainERC20` is a token standard designed to enable asset interoperability in the Superchain ecosystem. 
It serves as the foundational token deployment pattern within the Superchain, including `GovToken`, `WETH` (Wrapped Ether), migrated `OptimismMintableERC20Tokens`, and newly minted native `SuperchainERC20`. 
This standard is crucial for enabling a more interconnected and efficient token ecosystem within the Superchain, balancing the needs for interoperability, security, and simplified developer experience.

## Features and benefits

*   **Interoperability**: Enables seamless token transfers between different chains within the Superchain ecosystem, which decreases fragmentation of liquidity.
*   **Simplifies deployments**: Provides a consistent, unified standard for tokens across all Superchain-compatible networks and a common crosschain interface for the EVM ecosystem at large.
*   **Permissionless propagation**: Easily clone an existing token contract to a new OP Stack chain using `create2` without requiring the original owner, which enables movement of assets to the new chain once Interop goes live. Importantly, permissionless propagation retains the integrity of the original owner on the contract and preserves security but proliferates the contract's availability to new chains.
*   **Ethereum-aligned**: Intentionally designed to be supported across the EVM ecosystem (RIP coming soon).

## Major components

*   **Token Contract**: implements the `SuperchainERC20` standard with bridging functionality.
*   **Factory Predeploy**: uses a `create2`-based factory for deploying `SuperchainERC20` tokens consistently across chains.
*   **Bridging Functions**: using methods like `sendERC20` and `relayERC20` for cross-chain transfers.
*   **Minting Role**: modifies the definition to be minting role-based rather than interface-based.

## Comparison to other standards

`SuperchainERC20` differs from other token standards in its focus and implementation:

*   `SuperchainERC20` has minimal differentiation from a standard ERC20 deployment, only requiring a minimal crosschain mint/burn interface, which aims to be a common pattern for the EVM ecosystem (RIP coming soon).
*   `SuperchainERC20` shares trust assumptions across all chains in the superchain, such that custom assumptions around security and latency are not required to account for when executing transfers.

<Callout type="info">
  Projects moving from other token standards may need to adapt to the `SuperchainERC20` specification.
</Callout>

## Implementation details

Application developers must complete two tasks to enable `SuperchainERC20`. This advance setup ensures that `SuperchainERC20` goes live when the Interop upgrade happens and tokens becomes interoperable.

1.  Permission only `SuperchainERC20Bridge` to call `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`.
2.  Deployment at same address on every chain in the Superchain using `create2` function.

For now, application developers should view `SuperchainERC20`as standard ERC20 tokens with additional built-in functions that will be enabled once Interop goes live.

<Callout type="warning">
  `SuperchainERC20` token must give access to the address where the future Interop bridge will live.
