# Anatomy of a Cross-Chain Message

A cross-chain message applies to any asset using the [SuperchainERC20](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html) token standard. Two transactions are required to complete a cross chain message:

*   **First transaction:** is submitted to the source chain and emits an event that can be consumed on a destination chain.
*   **Second transaction:** is submitted to a destination chain, where the block builder SHOULD only include it if certain that the first transaction was included in the source chain. NOTE: There is no strict requirement that the executing message is ever submitted.

  See the specs for details on tracing the [executing message event](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#executingmessage-event).
</Callout>

## How It Works

To send a cross-chain message on the Superchain using [native OP Stack interoperability](explainer), these two aspects must be in place:

1.  Each interoperable chain runs a verifying node for each chain in the interoperable set.
2.  Each cross-chain message has an initiating transaction on the source chain and a finalizing transaction on the destination chain.

In the example above, `Ox123` sends 1 OP from OP Mainnet to Base, but this applies to any asset using the SuperchainERC20 token standard.

## Next Steps

*   More questions? Check out the FAQ section in the [OP Stack's Native Interop Explainer](explainer#faqs) or check out this [interop design video walk-thru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKc5RgjtGes).
*   Ready to get started? Use [SuperSim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim), a local dev environment that simulates interop for testing applications against a local version of the Superchain.
*   For more info about how OP Stack interoperability works under the hood, [check out the specs](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html).
