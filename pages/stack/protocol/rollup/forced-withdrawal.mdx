## Overview

This guide explains the nuances of forced withdrawals and deposits transactions and their implications during sequencer downtime.

Users are allowed to force-include deposit transactions, which can initiate withdrawals, at any time.
However, there are important nuances to understand about the chain derivation pipeline and sequencer behavior.

## Key Concepts

*   **Sequencing Window**: A 12-hour rolling window to include L2 transactions based on L1 data.
*   **Max Time Drift**: 15 minutes, the maximum delay for including a deposit transaction.
*   **Sequencer Downtime**: Period when the sequencer is offline or not producing blocks.

## Normal Operation

Under normal circumstances:

1.  Deposit transactions are included within 15 minutes.
2.  The sequencer processes transactions and produces blocks regularly.

## Sequencer Downtime Scenarios

### Short Downtime (< 15 minutes)

*   Deposits are still included within the 15-minute max time drift.
*   Regular L2 transactions may be delayed.

### Extended Downtime (15 minutes to 12 hours)

1.  Deposits are force-included within 15 minutes.
2.  The L2 chain state remains uncertain until:
    *   The sequencer comes back online, or
    *   The 12-hour sequencing window expires.

### Prolonged Downtime (> 12 hours)

1.  After 12 hours, nodes start generating blocks deterministically.
2.  These blocks only include deposit transactions.
3.  When the sequencer returns:
    *   All deposit transactions are included first.
    *   Regular L2 transactions resume afterwards.

## Important Considerations

*   Forced deposits ensure timely execution of actions, mitigating risks like DEX price divergence during sequencer downtime.
*   Actions remain speculative for up to 12 hours due to the sequencing window.
*   The 12-hour window is a balance between operational reliability and minimizing potential L2 reorganizations.

## Example Scenario

If a deposit is initiated after the 15-minute mark but before the sequencing window expires:

1.  The deposit will be effective when the sequencing window expires (up to \~11 hours later).
2.  Nodes reading data from L1 will produce a block with the deposit after the sequencing window expires.
3.  The eventual L2 chain will include the deposit in a block with an onchain timestamp close to the L1 block where the deposit originated.

  The sequencing window is a rolling 12-hour delay from when an L1 block is first known. This design allows the sequencer a grace period to come back online without causing L2 chain reorganizations.

## Conclusion

The forced withdrawal/deposit mechanism on OP chains provides a robust way to handle sequencer downtime, ensuring that critical transactions like deposits are included in a timely manner. While the 12-hour sequencer window introduces a degree of uncertainty during downtime, the system is designed to guarantee eventual consistency and transaction inclusion.
