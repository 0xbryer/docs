# Issuing new assets with SuperchainERC20

This guide explains how to issue new assets with the `SuperchainERC20` and bridge them effectively using the `SuperchainERC20Bridge`. If you want more information about the `SuperchainERC20 standard`, see our [`SuperchainERC20` standard explainer](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20)

An important thing to note is using `crosschainBurn` and `crosschainMint` on the `SuperchainERC20` to move your asset across the Superchain only affects which chain your asset is located on and does not change the overall supply of the token. This keeps the tokenâ€™s total amount the same across all networks, ensuring its value stays stable during the move and that the `SuperchainERC20` retains a unified, global supply count.


## Steps to issue and bridge assets

<Steps>
### Deploy the `SuperchainERC20` Token Contract

To ensure fungibility across chains, the SuperchainERC20 assets need to have the same contract address on all chains. Achieving this requires deterministic deployment methods, such as:

* `Create2Deployer`: A smart contract that enables deploying contracts with predictable addresses.
* `OptimismSuperchainERC20Factory`: A factory contract designed for L1-native tokens to ensure uniform deployments across chains.

There are [many ways to do this](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy), but [here's an example smart contract to start](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol)

By deploying assets at identical addresses across multiple chains, we abstract away the complexity of cross-chain validation.

### Implement the IERC7802 interface

Implementations of `SuperchainERC2` will be required to implement the [IERC7802](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html#ierc7802) interface, that includes two external functions and two events.

We'll use two function for bridging:

* `sendERC20`: initializes a cross-chain transfer of a `SuperchainERC20` by burning the tokens locally and sending a message to the `SuperchainERC20Bridge` on the target chain using the `L2toL2CrossDomainMessenger`. This ensures that asset supply never changes; sending an asset moves it from one chain to another, it does not "create" an additional asset in regards to supply.
* `relayERC20`: process incoming messages from the L2toL2CrossDomainMessenger and mints the corresponding amount of the SuperchainERC20.

[Here's an example implementation of the `SuperchainERC20Bridge`](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html#implementation)
