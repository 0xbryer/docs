# Interop devnet

The Interop Devnet is a temporary public network of two OP Stack Sepolia instances that supports SuperERC20 tokens, native cross-chain messaging, and cross-chain ETH transfers. This network will be deprecated once the next devnet is released.

1.  The "currency symbol" is required by some wallets like MetaMask.
2.  The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1 and L2. Messages sent directly to the `OptimismPortal` have no form of replayability. You can send ether directly to the portal to receive it to the sender address on the L2.

## Sending ETH to the interop devnets

<Steps>
  ### Get Sepolia ETH

  You can utilize the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) to get ether on Sepolia.

  ### Send the Sepolia ETH to the devnet

  You can send ether directly to the `OptimismPortal` address and it will go to the same sender address on the devnet.

  ### Wait for bridging to complete

  It'll take approximately 2 minutes for the bridging process to complete and the ether to appear in your wallet.
