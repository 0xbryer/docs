# Best practices for deploying new assets with SuperchainERC20

The following best practices are essential for deploying and managing `SuperchainERC20` assets across Superchain-compatible networks. These guidelines help ensure optimal cross-chain functionality, consistent metadata, and efficient resource utilization.

## Consistent addressing across chains

* Use predefined addresses: Assign and verify unique addresses for each `SuperchainERC20` instance on every chain. Predefined addresses reduce deployment conflicts and ensure tokens are accurately recognized across chains.

## Token metadata consistency

* Standardize token metadata: Use identical values for `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` across all chain instances. Inconsistent metadata can lead to display errors and transaction rejections during cross-chain operations.
  
* Implement metadata verification: Add checks to ensure that metadata (e.g., `decimals`) matches across chains.

## Efficient cross-chain transfers with crosschainBurn and crosschainMint

* Maintain supply consistency: Use `crosschainBurn` to decrement token balances on the originating chain and `crosschainMint` to increase balances on the destination chain. These functions should mirror asset movement across chains without altering the total supply.

* Implement error handling in transfer functions: Validate addresses and amounts before initiating cross-chain transfers. Cross-chain transfers are irreversible, so checks help prevent unrecoverable asset loss.

## Optimizing gas usage for high-volume transfers

* Minimize storage access: Use memory variables instead of storage where possible in high-frequency functions. Reduced storage access lowers gas fees, improving efficiency for high-volume transactions.

* Batch transfers within gas limits: For batch transfers, ensure that gas limits are optimized to accommodate transaction volumes. Where possible, split large transactions to prevent them from failing due to gas constraints.

## Sequence for deployment and bridging

* Deploy on the origin chain first: Start with deployment on the primary chain to serve as the authoritative ledger for total supply. Subsequent chain instances should use this origin to track and verify supply.

* Bridge tokens sequentially: When deploying across multiple chains, bridge tokens in a consistent, sequential order from the origin chain. This helps prevent supply misalignment and ensures accurate tracking.

## Comprehensive testing before mainnet deployment

- **Test with production-like conditions**: Deploy to staging environments that simulate mainnet conditions, especially for functions like `crosschainBurn` and `crosschainMint`. Test under realistic transaction loads to validate performance. We recommend using [Supersim](https://supersim.pages.dev/introduction) as an easy way to simulate the Superchain and test your SuperchainERC20 deployment.
