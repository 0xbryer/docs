This guide provides an overview of transferring SuperchainERC20 tokens between chains. For detailed technical steps and commands, see the [technical reference guide](https://supersim.pages.dev/guides/interop/manually-relaying-interop-messages-cast).

## Overview

Transferring SuperchainERC20 tokens between chains involves two main phases:

1. **Source Chain Operations**
   - Mint tokens if needed
   - Initiate the transfer using the bridge
   
2. **Destination Chain Operations**
   - Relay the transfer message
   - Verify the transfer completion

<Callout type="warning">
  Always verify your addresses and amounts before sending transactions. Cross-chain transfers cannot be reversed.
</Callout>

## How it works

<Steps>

### Step 1: Prepare your tokens

First, ensure you have tokens on the source chain. You can mint new tokens if needed using the [L2NativeSuperchainERC20](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/blob/main/contracts/src/L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol) contract.

### Step 2: Initiate the transfer

Use the bridge contract to start the transfer process. This will lock or burn your tokens on the source chain.

### Step 3: Complete the transfer

Relay the transfer message on the destination chain to complete the process. This will mint or unlock your tokens.

### Step 4: Verify completion

Check your balance on the destination chain to confirm the transfer was successful.

## Alternative methods

You can also use:

*   `supersim --interop.autorelay` for development environments
*   [viem bindings/actions](https://supersim.pages.dev/guides/interop/relay-using-viem) for TypeScript integration
