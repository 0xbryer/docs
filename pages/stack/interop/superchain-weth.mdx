# SuperchainWETH (Interoperable ETH)

<Callout>
  Interop is currently in active development and not yet ready for production use. The information provided here may change. Check back regularly for the most up-to-date information.
</Callout>

Superchain WETH or Interoperable ETH is a specialized version of the standard WETH (Wrapped Ether) contract designed to enable seamless movement of ETH across the Superchain. It addresses the liquidity constraints and usability issues that arise when transferring ETH between different chains.

## Features and benefits

*   Enables seamless ETH transfers across different chains in the Superchain
*   Minimizes protocol complexity by treating ETH as an ERC-20 token
*   Maintains fungibility of ETH across the Superchain
*   Provides liquidity for cross-chain transactions
*   Supports interoperability between chains with different native assets (i.e., gas tokens)
*   Improves user experience by abstracting complex bridging processes

<Callout type="warning">
  `SuperchainWETH` requires `SuperchainTokenBridge` integration for full interoperable, cross-chain functionality.
</Callout>

## How it works

Interoperable ETH (Superchain WETH) facilitates secure movement of ETH across the Superchain via `crosschainBurn` and `crosschainMint`.

*   **`crosschainBurn`**: Facilitates cross-chain transfers by **burning** WETH. The user sends ETH to the `SuperchainWETH` contract. `SuperchainWETH` interacts with `ETHLiquidity` to burn the ETH and sends a cross-chain message via the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` to the destination chain.
*   **`crosschainMint`**: Mints WETH on the destination chain after a cross-chain transfer. The user receives ETH or WETH on the destination chain. If the destination is a non-custom gas token chain, ETH is sourced from the `ETHLiquidity` contract.

    User->>SuperchainWETH: Send ETH
    SuperchainWETH->>ETHLiquidity: Burn ETH
    SuperchainWETH->>L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger: Send cross-chain message
    L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger->>DestinationChain: Relay message
    DestinationChain->>SuperchainWETH: Call relayETH/relayERC20
    SuperchainWETH->>ETHLiquidity: Source ETH (if non-custom gas token chain)
    SuperchainWETH->>User: Receive ETH/WETH on destination chain
```

This diagram illustrates the process where the user sends ETH to the `SuperchainWETH` contract which burns the ETH and sends a cross-chain message to the destination chain, enabling seamless cross-chain ETH transfers without the need for asset wrapping.

## Major components

### `SuperchainWETH` Contract

This contract implements the core functionality for wrapping, unwrapping, and cross-chain transfer of ETH. It integrates with the `SuperchainTokenBridge` for interoperable actions. 
*   Contract address: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000024`

### `ETHLiquidity` Contract

A predeploy contract with a large pool of ETH that provides liquidity for cross-chain transfers. It allows "burning" and "minting" of ETH for cross-chain transfers. 
*   Contract address: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000025`

### `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` Contract

This predeploy contract facilitates general message passing between different chains in the Superchain. It also securely transfers ERC20 tokens between L2 chains. 
*   Contract address: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023`

<Callout type="info">
  `SuperchainWETH` implements strict access controls to ensure security (e.g., only `SuperchainWETH` can call `ETHLiquidity` functions).
