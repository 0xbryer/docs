# Smart Contract Overview

This guide provides an overview of the functionality of the smart contract components. You can also find [contract addresses](/chain/addresses) on OP Mainnet.

## Layer 1 Contracts

The layer 1 contracts of the OP Stack are deployed on Ethereum. Their primary
purpose is to facilitate the cross domain message passing and maintain the
valid state root of the layer 2.

### Official Releases

The full smart contract release process is documented in the [monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism?tab=readme-ov-file#development-and-release-process).
All production releases are always tags, versioned as `<component-name>/v<semver>`
and contract releases you'll see them tagged as `op-contract/vX.X.X`.

<Callout type="warning">
  For contract releases, refer to the GitHub release notes for a given release,
  which will list the specific contracts being releasedâ€”**not all contracts are
  considered production ready within a release**, and many are under active
  development. These release pages are linked below.

  Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.1.4`, indicate releases of all Go code
  only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.

#### op-contracts/v1.4.0 - Fault Proofs

This protocol upgrade reduces the trust assumptions for users of the OP Stack
by enabling permissionless output proposals and a permissionless fault proof
system. As part of a responsible and safe rollout of Fault Proofs, it preserves
the ability for the guardian to override if necessary to maintain security.

As a result, withdrawals no longer depend on the privileged proposer role
posting an output root, allowing the entire withdrawal process to be completed
without any privileged actions. The trust assumption is reduced to requiring
only that the guardian role does not act to intervene.

Combined with the Guardian, Security Council Threshold and L2 ProxyAdmin
Ownership changes 23 proposal, this satisfies the criteria to have OP Chains
reach Stage 1 status.

#### op-contracts/v1.3.0 - Multi-Chain Prep (MCP)

This protocol upgrade strengthens the security and upgradeability of the
Superchain by enabling L1 contracts to be upgraded atomically across multiple
chains in a single transaction. This upgrade also extends the `SystemConfig`
to contain the addresses of the contracts in the network, allowing users to
discover the system's contract addresses programmatically.

#### op-contracts/v1.1.0 - ProtocolVersions

The Protocol Version documents the progression of the total set of canonical
OP Stack specifications. Components of the OP Stack implement the subset of
their respective protocol component domain, up to a given Protocol Version
of the OP Stack.

The Protocol Version is NOT a hardfork identifier, but rather indicates
software-support for a well-defined set of features introduced in past and
future hardforks, not the activation of said hardforks.

<Callout type="info">
  The Protocol Version only applies to the Protocol specifications with the
  [Superchain Targets](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html#superchain-target)
  specified within. This versioning is independent of the Semver versioning
  used in OP Stack smart contracts, and the Semver-versioned reference software
  of the OP-Stack. This is an optional feature.

### L1 Contract Details

#### [DelayedVetoable](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/DelayedVetoable.sol)

This contract enables a delay before a call is forwarded to a target contract,
and during the delay period the call can be vetoed by the authorized vetoer.
This contract does not support value transfers, only data is forwarded.
Additionally, this contract cannot be used to forward calls with data beginning
with the function selector of the `queuedAt(bytes32)` function. This is because
of input validation checks performed by Solidity at runtime on functions
which take an argument.

#### [L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol)

The L1CrossDomainMessenger is a message passing interface between L1 and L2
responsible for sending and receiving data on the L1 side. Users are encouraged
to use this interface instead of interacting with lower-level contracts directly.

#### [L1ERC721Bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol)

The `L1ERC721bridge` is a contract which works together with the L2 ERC721 bridge
to make it possible to transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Optimism. This
contract acts as an escrow for ERC721 tokens deposited into L2.

#### [L1StandardBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1StandardBridge.sol)

<Callout type="warning">
  This contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
  of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
  not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
</Callout>

The `L1StandardBridge` is responsible for transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens between L1 and
L2. In the case that an ERC20 token is native to L1, it will be escrowed within this
contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be burnt. Before Bedrock, ETH was
stored within this contract. After Bedrock, ETH is instead stored inside the
OptimismPortal contract.

#### [L2OutputOracle](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol)

The `L2OutputOracle` contains an array of L2 state outputs, where each output is a
commitment to the state of the L2 chain. Other contracts like the `OptimismPortal` use
these outputs to verify information about the state of L2.

#### [OptimismPortal](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal.sol)

The `OptimismPortal` is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1
and L2. Messages sent directly to the `OptimismPortal` have no form of replayability.
Users are encouraged to use the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` for a higher-level interface.

#### [ProtocolVersions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ProtocolVersions.sol)

The `ProtocolVersions` contract is used to manage Superchain protocol version information.

#### [ResourceMetering](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ResourceMetering.sol)

`ResourceMetering` implements an EIP-1559 style resource metering system where pricing
updates automatically based on current demand.

#### [SuperchainConfig](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SuperchainConfig.sol)

The `SuperchainConfig` contract is used to manage configuration of global Superchain values.

#### [SystemConfig](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/op-contracts/v1.3.0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SystemConfig.sol)

The `SystemConfig` contract is used to manage configuration of an OP Stack network.
All configuration is stored on L1 and picked up by L2 as part of the derivation of
the L2 chain.

## Layer 2 Contracts (Predeploys)

Predeployed smart contracts exist at predetermined addresses in the genesis
state. They are similar to precompiles but instead run directly in the EVM
instead of running native code outside of the EVM.

Predeploys are used instead of precompiles to make it easier for multiclient
implementations as well as allowing for more integration with hardhat/foundry
network forking.

### LegacyMessagePasser

The `LegacyMessagePasser` was the low-level mechanism used to send messages
from L2 to L1 before the Bedrock upgrade.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000000`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** yes
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** [v]()

### DeployerWhitelist

`DeployerWhitelist` is a legacy contract that was originally used to act as a
whitelist of addresses allowed to the Optimism network. The `DeployerWhitelist`
has since been disabled, but the code is kept in state for the sake of full
backwards compatibility. As of the Bedrock upgrade, the `DeployerWhitelist` is
completely unused by the Optimism system and could, in theory, be removed entirely.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000002`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** yes
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** [v]()

### LegacyERC20ETH

`LegacyERC20ETH` is a legacy contract that held ETH balances before the Bedrock
upgrade. All ETH balances held within this contract were migrated to the state
trie as part of the Bedrock upgrade. Functions within this contract that mutate
state were already disabled as part of the EVM equivalence upgrade.

*   **Address:** `0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** yes
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** [v]()

### WETH9

`WETH9` is the standard implementation of Wrapped Ether. It is a commonly used
contract and is placed as a predeploy so that it is at a deterministic address.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** no
*   **Proxied:** no
*   **Implementation:** []()

### L2CrossDomainMessenger

The `L2CrossDomainMessenger` is a high-level interface for message passing
between L1 and L2 on the L2 side. Users are generally encouraged to use this
contract instead of lower level message passing contracts.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** no
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** []()

### L2StandardBridge

<Callout type="warning">
  This contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
  of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
  not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
</Callout>

The `L2StandardBridge` is responsible for transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens between L1 and
L2. In the case that an ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be escrowed within this
contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L1, it will be burnt.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** no
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** []()

### SequencerFeeVault

The `SequencerFeeVault` is the contract that holds any fees paid to the
Sequencer during transaction processing and block production.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011`
*   **Introduced:** Legacy
*   **Deprecated:** no
*   **Proxied:** yes
*   **Implementation:** []()

### OptimismMintableERC20Factory

The `OptimismMintableERC20Factory` is responsible for creating ERC20 contracts
on L2 that can be used for depositing native L1 tokens into. These ERC20
contracts can be created permisionlessly and implement the interface required
by the StandardBridge to just work with deposits and withdrawals.

Each ERC20 contract that is created by the `OptimismMintableERC20Factory`
allows for the L2StandardBridge to mint and burn tokens, depending on if the
user is depositing from L1 to L2 or withdrawing from L2 to L1.

### L1BlockNumber

`L1BlockNumber` is a legacy contract that fills the roll of the
`OVM_L1BlockNumber` contract in the old version of the Optimism system. Only
necessary for backwards compatibility. If you want to access the L1 block
number going forward, you should use the `L1Block`contract instead.

### GasPriceOracle

In the legacy system, the `GasPriceOracle` was a permissioned contract that was
pushed the L1 base fee and the L2 gas price by an offchain actor. The offchain
actor observes the L1 blockheaders to get the L1 base fee as well as the gas
usage on L2 to compute what the L2 gas price should be based on a congestion
control algorithm.

After Bedrock, the `GasPriceOracle` is no longer a permissioned contract and
only exists to preserve the API for offchain gas estimation. The function
`getL1Fee(bytes)` accepts an unsigned RLP transaction and will return the L1
portion of the fee. This fee pays for using L1 as a data availability layer
and should be added to the L2 portion of the fee, which pays for execution,
to compute the total transaction fee.

The values used to compute the L1 portion of the fee prior to the Ecotone
upgrade are:

*   `scalar`
*   `overhead`
*   `decimals`

After the Bedrock upgrade, these values are instead managed by the
`SystemConfig` contract on L1. The scalar and overhead values are sent to the
`L1Block` contract each block and the decimals value has been hardcoded to 6.

Following the Ecotone upgrade, the values used for L1 fee computation are:

*   `baseFeeScalar`
*   `blobBaseFeeScalar`
*   `decimals`

These new scalar values are managed by the `SystemConfig` contract on the L1 by
introducing a backwards compatible versioned encoding scheme of its scalars
storage slot. The decimals remains hardcoded to 6, and the overhead value is
ignored.

### GovernanceToken

The OP token used in governance and supporting voting and delegation.
Implements EIP 2612 allowing signed approvals. Contract is "owned" by a
`MintManager` instance with permission to the `mint` function only, for the
purposes of enforcing the token inflation schedule.

### L1Block

The `L1Block` predeploy gives users access to information about the last known
L1 block. Values within this contract are updated once per epoch (every L1
block) and can only be set by the "depositor" account, a special system
address. Depositor account transactions are created by the protocol whenever we
move to a new epoch.

### L2ToL1MessagePasser

<Callout>
  There is a legacy contract under this same name.
</Callout>

The `L2ToL1MessagePasser` is a dedicated contract where messages that are being
sent from L2 to L1 can be stored. The storage root of this contract is pulled
up to the top level of the L2 output to reduce the cost of proving the
existence of sent messages.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000016`
*   **Introduced:** Bedrock

### L2ERC721Bridge

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This
  bridge ONLY supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to
  wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT
  can be refunded on L2.
</Callout>

The `L2ERC721Bridge` is a contract which works together with the L1 ERC721 bridge to
make it possible to transfer ERC721 tokens from Ethereum to Optimism. This contract
acts as a minter for new tokens when it hears about deposits into the L1 ERC721 bridge.
This contract also acts as a burner for tokens being withdrawn.

### ProxyAdmin

The `ProxyAdmin` is the owner of all of the proxy contracts set at the
predeploys. It is itself behind a proxy. The owner of the `ProxyAdmin` will
have the ability to upgrade any of the other predeploy contracts.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000018`

### BaseFeeVault

The `BaseFeeVault` predeploy receives the base fees on L2. The base fee is not
burnt on L2 like it is on L1. Once the contract has received a certain amount
of fees, the ETH can be withdrawn to an immutable address on L1.

*   **Address:** `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000019`

### L1FeeVault

The `L1FeeVault` predeploy receives the L1 portion of the transaction fees.
Once the contract has received a certain amount of fees, the ETH can be
withdrawn to an immutable address on L1.

*   **Address:** `0x420000000000000000000000000000000000001a`
