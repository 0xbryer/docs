# op-conductor

This page will teach you what the `op-conductor` service is and how it works on
a high level. It will also get you started on setting it up in your own 
environment.

## op-conductor: Enhancing Sequencer Reliability and Availability

The [op-conductor](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-conductor) 
is an auxiliary service designed to enhance the reliability and availability of
a sequencer within high-availability setups. By minimizing the risks 
associated with a single point of failure, the op-conductor ensures that the 
sequencer remains operational and responsive.

### Assumptions

It is important to note that the `op-conductor` does not incorporate Byzantine 
fault tolerance (BFT). This means the system operates under the assumption that 
all participating nodes are honest and act correctly. 

### Summary of Guarantees

The design of the `op-conductor` provides the following guarantees:

*   **No Unsafe Reorgs** 
*   **No Unsafe Head Stall During Network Partition**
*   **100% Uptime with No More Than 1 Node Failure**

## Design

**On a high level, `op-conductor` serves the following functions:**

### Raft Consensus Layer Participation

*   **Leader Determination:** Participates in the Raft consensus algorithm to 
determine the leader among sequencers.
*   **State Management:** Stores the latest unsafe block ensuring consistency 
across the system.
 

### RPC Request Handling

*   **Admin RPC:** Provides administrative RPCs for manual recovery scenarios, 
including, but not limited to: stopping the leadership vote and removing itself 
from the cluster.
*   **Health RPC** Offers health RPCs for the `op-node` to determine whether it 
should allow the publishing of transactions and unsafe blocks.

### Sequencer Health Monitoring

*   Continuously monitors the health of the sequencer (op-node) to ensure 
optimal performance and reliability.

### Control Loop Management

*   Implements a control loop to manage the status of the sequencer (op-node), 
including starting and stopping operations based on different scenarios and 
health checks.

## Conductor State Transition

The following is a state machine diagram of how the op-conductor manages the 
sequencers Raft consensus.

**Helpful tips:** To better understand the graph, focus on one node at a time, 
understand what can be transitioned to this current state and how it can 
transition to other states. This way you could understand how we handle the 
state transitions.
