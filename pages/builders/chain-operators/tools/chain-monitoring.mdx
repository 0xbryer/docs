# Chain Monitoring Options

This explainer covers the basics of **onchain** and **offchain** monitoring options for your OP Stack chain.

*   Onchain monitoring services provide insights into the overall system and helps chain operators track and monitor onchain events. Some examples of onchain monitoring services include `chain-mon` and `dispute-mon`.
*   Offchain monitoring allows chain operators to monitor the operation and behavior of nodes and other offchain components. Some examples of offchain component monitoring include `op-node`, `op-geth`, and `op-proposer`.

## Onchain Monitoring Services

Onchain monitoring services provide insights into the overall system and helps chain operators track and monitor onchain events. Some examples of onchain monitoring services include `chain-mon` and `dispute-mon`.

## Offchain Component Monitoring

Offchain monitoring allows chain operators to monitor the operation and behavior of nodes and other offchain components. Some of the more common components that you'll likely want to monitor include `op-node`, `op-geth`, `op-proposer`, `op-batcher`, and `op-challenger`.
The general steps for enabling offchain monitoring is pretty consistent for all the OP components:

*   Expose the monitoring port by enabling the `-â€”metrics.enabled` flag
*   Use Prometheus to scrape data from the metrics port
*   Save the data in `influxdb`
*   Share the data with grafana to build your custom dashboard

### `op-node`

`op-node` metrics and monitoring is detailed in the [Node Metrics and Monitoring](/builders/node-operators/management/metrics) guide. To enable metrics, pass the `--metrics.enabled` flag to the op-node. You can customize the metrics port and address via the `--metrics.port` and `--metrics.addr` flags, respectively.
See [this curated list](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/management/metrics#important-metrics) for important metrics to track specifically for `op-node`.
