# Deployer

`op-deployer` simplifies the process of deploying the OP Stack. It works similarly to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). Like Terraform, you define a declarative config file called an "intent," then run a command to apply the intent to your chain. `op-deployer` will compare the state of your chain against the intent, and make whatever changes are necessary for them to match. In its current state, it is intended to deploy new standard chains. Upgrade funcionality and beta-feature support will likely come in the future.

## Installation

todo: we need to link a production ready release of op-deployer

`op-deployer` is currently under active development, and must be compiled from source. Assuming you have the Go
toolchain installed, you can install `op-deployer` by following these steps:

<Steps>
    ### **Clone the monorepo**:

    Run the following command to clone the monorepo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
    ```

    ### **Build the binary**:

    Run the following commands to build the binary:

    ```bash
    cd op-deployer
    just build
    ```
</Steps>

## Usage

### Configuring your chain

To get started with `op-deployer`, you need to create an intent file that outlines your desired chain configuration. You can use the built-in `op-deployer` utility to generate this file. Just run the following command to create an example intent file for a development chain:

```
./bin/op-deployer init --l1-chain-id 11155111 --l2-chain-ids 12345 --workdir .deployer
```

This command will create a directory called `.deployer` in your current working directory containing the intent file
and an empty `state.json` file. `state.json` is populated with the results of your deployment, and never needs to
be edited directly.

Your intent file will look something like this:

todo: update the toml file for the latest output
todo: add annotations on each of the chains.roles

```toml
deploymentStrategy = "live" # todo: add description
l1ChainID = 11155111 # The chain ID of the L1 chain you'll be deploying to
fundDevAccounts = true # Whether or not to fund dev accounts using the test... junk mnemonic on L2.
l1ContractsLocator = "tag://op-contracts/v1.6.0" # The version of the L1 smart contracts to deploy.
l2ContractsLocator = "tag://op-contracts/v1.7.0-beta.1+l2-contracts" # The version of the L2 smart contracts to encode into genesis

# todo: add comment on this section

  proxyAdminOwner = "0xb9cdf788704088a4c0191d045c151fcbe2db14a4" # todo: whose address is this?
  protocolVersionsOwner = "0x85d646ed26c3f46400ede51236d8d7528196849b" # todo: add comment
  guardian = "0x8c7e4a51acb17719d225bd17598b8a94b46c8767" # todo: is this the guardian on the superchain config contract?

# List of L2s to deploy. op-deployer can deploy multiple L2s at once

  # Your chain's ID, encoded as a 32-byte hex string
  id = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003039"
  # todo: comments on these values 
  baseFeeVaultRecipient = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  l1FeeVaultRecipient = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  sequencerFeeVaultRecipient = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  eip1559Elasticity = 6
  # Various ownership roles for your chain. When you use op-deployer init, these roles are generated using the
  # test... junk mnemonic. You should replace these with your own addresses for production chains.
  [chains.roles]
    proxyAdminOwner = "0x7759a8a43aa6a7ee9434ddb597beed64180c40fd" # todo: highlight the difference between this and the one in the [superchainRoles]
    systemConfigOwner = "0x8e35d9523a0c4c9ac537d254079c2398c6f3b35f" # todo: mention that the chain operator should retain this role for system behavior modifications
    governanceTokenOwner = "0x7759a8a43aa6a7ee9434ddb597beed64180c40fd" # todo: what guidance should we have on this
    unsafeBlockSigner = "0xbb19dce4ce51f353a98dbab31b5fa3bc80dc7769"
    batcher = "0x0e9c62712ab826e06b16b2236ce542f711eaffaf"
    proposer = "0x86dfafe0689e20685f7872e0cb264868454627bc"
    challenger = "0xf1658da627dd0738c555f9572f658617511c49d5" # todo: what address should this be?
```

See the code comments above for explanations of each field. By default, `op-deployer` will fill in all other configuration variables
with those that match our standard config. You can override these defaults by adding them to your intent file, but
that won't be covered here.

### Overriding default values

The default values that op-deployer utilizes are defined [here](todo: add link). If you'd like to override these values, you need to add the following stanza to your intent file like this:

```toml
todo: add override examples
```

todo: reference the default values 
todo: figure our if we should use the global overrides or the chain overrides
todo: give example of 1s blocktime override
todo: how do you deploy your own superchain contracts? opt out of the shared ones

### Applying your intent

Now that you've created your intent file, you can apply it to your chain:

```
./bin/op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer --l1-rpc-url <rpc-url> --private-key <private key hex>
```

Hardware wallets are not supported, but you can use ephemeral hot wallets since this deployer key has no privileges.

This command will deploy the OP Stack to L1. It will deploy all L2s specified in the intent file. Superchain
configuration will be set to the Superchain-wide defaults - i.e., your chain will be opted into the [Superchain pause](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-configuration.html#pausability)
and will use the same [protocol versions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/superchain-upgrades.md)
address as other chains on the Superchain.

### Generating genesis files
### Generating genesis files

With the contracts deployed, you can generate a genesis file for any of your L2s. Run the following command to do so:

```
./bin/op-deployer inspect genesis <l2-chain-id> --outfile genesis.json
```

This will write the genesis file to `genesis.json`. You can change the `--outfile` parameter to write it somewhere
else. You can run another member of the `inspect` family, `rollup`, to get the `rollup.json` file:

```
./bin/op-deployer inspect rollup <l2-chain-id> --outfile rollup.json
```
