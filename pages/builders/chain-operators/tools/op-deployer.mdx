# Deployer

This page will teach you what the `op-deployer` tool is and how it works on a high level. The purpose of this tool is to simplify the smart contract deployment process and the genesis file creation process for new OP Stack chains. It is similar to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) where you can create intent files to describe how you want your chain to be configured.

## Contract Deployment

The `op-deployer` is a golang wrapper around [OP Contracts Manager](/stack/experimental/opcm). Here's a sample of its usage:

<Steps>
  ### Initialize chain

  Initializes a chain intent and state file with the following command:

  ```bash
  todo: confirm the command and any necessary parameters
  ./op-deployer init
  ```

  You can then modify the configuration files. Here's an example file with a standard configuration:

  ```yaml
  todo: add sample file
  ```

  ### Applies chain intent

  Use the following command to apply a chain intent to your network:

  ```bash
  todo: confirm the command and any necessary parameters
  ./op-deployer apply
  ```

  ### Inspect deployment

  Use the following command to inspect the details of your deployment:

  ```
  todo: confirm the command and any necessary parameters
  ./op-deployer inspect
  ```
</Steps>

## Genesis Creation

todo: is this baked into the commands above?

The `op-deployer` will take the smart contract deployment artifacts and to generate the genesis file for your layer two network.
