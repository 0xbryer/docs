# Deployer

`op-deployer` simplifies the process of deploying the the OP Stack. It works similarly to [Terraform]
(https://www.terraform.io). Like Terraform, you define a declarative config file called an "intent," then run a
command to apply the intent to your chain. `op-deployer` will compare the state of your chain against the intent,
and make whatever changes are necessary for them to match.

## Installation

`op-deployer` is currently under active development, and must be compiled from source. Assuming you have the Go
toolchain installed, you can install `op-deployer` by running `go install github.
com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/op-chain-ops/cmd/op-deployer@latest`. This will install the `op-deployer` binary to
your local `GOPATH`.

## Usage

### Configuring your Chain

The first step to using `op-deployer` is to create an intent file. The intent file describes how you want your chain
to look when it is done being deployed. `op-deployer` has a utility for this. Run the following command to generate
an example intent file for a development chain:

```
op-deployer init --l1-chain-id 11155111 --l2-chain-ids 12345 --workdir .deployer
```

This command will create a directory called `.deployer` in your current working directory containing the intent file
and an empty `state.json` file. `state.json` is populated with the results of your deployment, and never needs to
be edited directly.

Your intent file will look something like this:

```toml
l1ChainID = 11155111 # The chain ID of the L1 chain you'll be deploying to
fundDevAccounts = true # Whether or not to fund dev accounts using the test... junk mnemonic on L2.
contractsRelease = "op-contracts/v1.6.0" # The version of the smart contracts to deploy.

# List of L2s to deploy. op-deployer can deploy multiple L2s at once
[[chains]]
# Your chain's ID, encoded as a 32-byte hex string
id = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003039"
# Various ownership roles for your chain. When you use op-deployer init, these roles are generated using the
# test... junk mnemonic. You should replace these with your own addresses for production chains.
[chains.roles]
proxyAdminOwner = "0x7759a8a43aa6a7ee9434ddb597beed64180c40fd"
systemConfigOwner = "0x8e35d9523a0c4c9ac537d254079c2398c6f3b35f"
governanceTokenOwner = "0x7759a8a43aa6a7ee9434ddb597beed64180c40fd"
unsafeBlockSigner = "0xbb19dce4ce51f353a98dbab31b5fa3bc80dc7769"
batcher = "0x0e9c62712ab826e06b16b2236ce542f711eaffaf"
proposer = "0x86dfafe0689e20685f7872e0cb264868454627bc"
challenger = "0xf1658da627dd0738c555f9572f658617511c49d5"
```

See the comments for what each field does. By default, `op-deployer` will fill in all other configuration variables
with those that match our standard config. You can override these defaults by adding them to your intent file, but
that won't be covered here.

### Applying your Intent

Now that you've created your intent file, you can apply it to your chain. Run the following command to do so:

```
op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer --l1-rpc-url <rpc-url> --private-key <private key hex>
```

This command will deploy the OP Stack to L1. It will deploy all L2s specified in the intent file. Superchain
configuration will be set to the Superchain-wide defaults - i.e., your chain will be opted into the Superchain pause
and will use the same protocol versions address as other chains on the Superchain.

### Generating Genesis Files

With the contracts deployed, you can generate a genesis file for any of your L2s. Run the following command to do so:

```
./bin/op-deployer inspect genesis <l2-chain-id> --outfile genesis.json
```

This will write the genesis file to genesis.json. You can change the `--outfile` parameter to write it somewhere
else. You can run another member of the `inspect` family, `rollup`, to get the rollup.json file:

```
./bin/op-deployer inspect rollup <l2-chain-id> --outfile rollup.json
```

## More Information

`op-deployer` uses the OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) under the hood to deploy contracts.
