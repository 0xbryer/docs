# Using Snap Sync

Snap sync enables developers to more quickly sync their nodes and is a mechanism for node operators to sync chains that are using blobs without a blob archiver.

<Callout type="warning">
  For snap sync, all `op-geth` nodes should be ran with public IP addresses to easily find other op-geth nodes to sync from. 
  The only exception is for sequencers and transaction ingress nodes.
</Callout>

## Enable Snap Sync for Chains

To enable snap sync, chain operators need to spin up a node which is exposed to the network and has transaction gossip disabled.
