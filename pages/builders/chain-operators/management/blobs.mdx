# Using Blobs

This guide walks you through how to switch to using blobs for your chain after Ecotone is activated. **For Kev: Why use blobs? What's the advantage? Need to explain that here.** 

<Callout type="info">
This guide is intended for chains already upgraded to Ecotone. Please see the [Ecotone Upgrade Notice](/builders/notices/ecotone-fee-changes) before continuing.
</Callout>

## Switch to Using Blobs

<Steps>
  {<h3>Set Recommended Fee Values</h3>}

  At the point of the fork, your current scalar setting will become the `BaseFeeScalar` value, and the `BlobBaseFeeScalar` will be set to `0`.
  When you enable blobs, if your chain is submitting mostly full blobs, then you'll want to configure `BlobBaseFeeScalar` to be somewhere around the previous `BaseFeeScalar`, and configure `BaseFeeScalar` to a low but non-zero value.
  For more details on fee scalar, see [Transaction Fees, Ecotone section](/stack/transactions/fees#ecotone).

  For devnet and testnet, once batcher moves to blobs, set the following:

  ```
  l1BaseFeeScalar = 7600
  l1BlobBaseFeeScalar = 862000
  ```

  <Callout type="warning">
    These scalar values assume that blobs are being completely filled with data.
    If you are not operating at high throughput (e.g., \~1000 txs per day) and if you only half-fill blobs, you will want to *double* these values to adjust accordingly.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Adjust Fees to Change Margins</h3>}

  If you've enabled blobs, the `BlobBaseFeeScalar` is going to be the most important for covering your L1 fees, so it's important to scale that parameter to achieve an appropriate margin.

  To increase the margin on L1 data fees by 10%, chains should do the following:

  *   `newL1BaseFeeScalar` = `prevl1BaseFeeScalar` \* 1.1
  *   `newl1BlobBaseFeeScalar` = `prevL1BlobBaseFeeScalar` \* 1.1

  ```shell
  function _getL1FeeEcotone(bytes memory _data) internal view returns (uint256) {
          uint256 l1GasUsed = _getCalldataGas(_data);
          uint256 scaledBaseFee = baseFeeScalar() * 16 * l1BaseFee();
          uint256 scaledBlobBaseFee = blobBaseFeeScalar() * blobBaseFee();
          uint256 fee = l1GasUsed * (scaledBaseFee + scaledBlobBaseFee);
          return fee / (16 * 10 ** DECIMALS);
      }
  ```

  {<h3>Encode Fee Values and Send the L1 Transaction to Set Values</h3>}

  The [ecotone-scalar utility](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops/cmd/ecotone-scalar) converts a desired `BaseFeeScalar` and `BlobBaseFeeScalar` into a single value that can be provided to the L1 `SystemConfig.setGasConfig` method through its `scalar` argument ("overhead" is ignored and can be set to `0`).

  Run the following code using the ecotone-scalar encoding tool:

  ```js
  go run ./op-chain-ops/cmd/ecotone-scalar --scalar=7600 --blob-scalar=862000
  # base fee scalar     : 7600
  # blob base fee scalar: 862000
  # v1 hex encoding  : 0x010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d273000001db0
  # uint value for the 'scalar' parameter in SystemConfig.setGasConfig():
  452312848583266388373324160190187140051835877600158453279134889792719822256
  ```

  You will get a value that looks something like: `0x010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d273000001db0`

  <Callout type="info">
    The `0x01` byte at the start indicates the version of the scalar, and the hex value at the end are the encoded scalars.
  </Callout>

  This value has to be called by the owner of the `SystemConfigProxy` L1 Contract:

  ```shell
  cast calldata 'setGasConfig(uint256,uint256)' 0 0x010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d273000001db0`
  ```

  Check that the L2 the gas price oracle returns the expected values for `baseFeeScalar` and `blobBaseFeeScalar` (wait \~1 minute):

  <Callout type="info">
    You'll have to provide a `gas-price` to geth when making this call.
  </Callout>

  ```shell
  cast call 0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F 'baseFeeScalar()(uint256)' --gas-price 10000000
  ```

  Finally, run the post-Ecotone GPO functions:

  ```shell
      /// @notice Retrieves the latest known L1 base fee.
      /// @return Latest known L1 base fee.
      function l1BaseFee() public view returns (uint256) {
          return L1Block(Predeploys.L1_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES).basefee();
      }

      /// @notice Retrieves the current blob base fee.
      /// @return Current blob base fee.
      function blobBaseFee() public view returns (uint256) {
          return L1Block(Predeploys.L1_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES).blobBaseFee();
      }

      /// @notice Retrieves the current base fee scalar.
      /// @return Current base fee scalar.
      function baseFeeScalar() public view returns (uint32) {
          return L1Block(Predeploys.L1_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES).baseFeeScalar();
      }

      /// @notice Retrieves the current blob base fee scalar.
      /// @return Current blob base fee scalar.
      function blobBaseFeeScalar() public view returns (uint32) {
          return L1Block(Predeploys.L1_BLOCK_ATTRIBUTES).blobBaseFeeScalar();
      }
  ```

  {<h3>Change the Batcher Configuration</h3>}

  Now that the fee config has been updated, immediately configure your batcher!
  Prepare the batcher update before you configure `OP_BATCHER_DATA_AVAILABILITY_TYPE=blobs`.

  <Callout type="info">
    The batcher will have to be restarted for it to take effect.
  </Callout>

  Also check if you are using a non-zero value for `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION`. When non-zero, this parameter is the max time (in L1 blocks, which are 12 seconds each) between which batches will be submitted to the L1.
  If you have this set to 5 for example, then your batcher will send a blob to the L1 every 5\*12=60 seconds. If your chain doesn't generate at least \~128kb of data in 60 seconds, then you'll be posting only partially full blobs and wasting storage.

  <Callout type="warning">
    Consider the following risks if setting `OP_BATCHER_MAX_CHANNEL_DURATION` to target 5 vs 10 hours:

    *   You have to submit batches within the 12-hour sequencing window.
    *   This also means your safe head will stall for 5 hours, which will negatively impact apps on your chain that rely on the safe head for operation (e.g., apps like Centralized Exchanges or third party bridges wait until txs are marked safe before processing a deposit/withdrawal).
    *   If your chain is currently processing less than 128KB per 5 hours, then your chain will not be using full blobs, so you will be overpaying.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

## Switch Back to Using Calldata

After posting to blob space, chains can follow these steps to switch from blobs back to using calldata. **For Kev: unclear why chains would want to do this. need explanation/more copy here.**

To do this, simply set `OP_BATCHER_DATA_AVAILABILITY_TYPE=calldata`

<Steps>
  {<h3>Use Recommended Calldata Fee Values</h3>}

  Please use the recommended fee values to ensure fees for calldata are charged accurately by doing the following:

  *   Stage your system config update transaction and stage your batcher to update.
  *   If you are using calldata, then you can set `BaseFeeScalar` similarly to how you would have set "scalar" prior to Ecotone, though with a 3-4% bump to compensate for the removal of the "overhead" component. `BlobBaseFeeScalar` should be set to 0.

  <Callout type="default">
    As soon as ecotone is activated, your `baseFeeScalar` will remain the same and `blobBaseFeeScalar` will default to `0`, but because of the removal of the overhead, you'll be taking 3-4% less margin on your L1 Data fees as stated above.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Adjust `BaseFeeScalar` Fee to Change Margins</h3>}

  Chains can update their fees to increase or decrease their margin. If using calldata, then `BaseFeeScalar` should be scaled to achieve the desired margin.

  {<h3>Encode Fee Values and Send the L1 Transaction to Set Values</h3>}

  The [ecotone-scalar utility](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops/cmd/ecotone-scalar) converts a desired `BaseFeeScalar` and `BlobBaseFeeScalar` into a single value that can be provided to the L1 `SystemConfig.setGasConfig` method through its "scalar" argument ("overhead" is ignored and can be set to `0`).
  For calldata, you'll want to set `BlobBaseFeeScalar` to `0` when using this utility.

  {<h3>Change the Batcher Configuration</h3>}

  To change the batcher configuration, either remove the `OP_BATCHER_DATA_AVAILABILITY_TYPE` parameter, or set its value to "calldata" instead of "blobs".
  The batcher will have to be restarted for this to take effect.
</Steps>

## Other Considerations

*   If you'd like to set up snap sync for your chain, you'll need to set up a [Boot Node](/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#configuring-peer-to-peer-networking).
*   If you want to enable archive nodes, you will need to access a blob archiver service. You can use [Optimism's](/builders/node-operators/management/snapshots#op-mainnet-archive-node) or [run your own](tools/explorer#create-an-archive-node).
