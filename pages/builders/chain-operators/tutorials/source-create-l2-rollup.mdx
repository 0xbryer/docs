## Fill Out Environment Variables

You'll need to fill out a few environment variables before you can start deploying your chain.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Duplicate the sample environment variable file</h3>}

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

{<h3>Fill out the environment variable file</h3>}

Open up the environment variable file and fill out the following variables:

| Variable Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `L1_RPC_URL`  | URL for your L1 node (a Sepolia node in this case).                                                                                                                                                          |
| `L1_RPC_KIND` | Kind of L1 RPC you're connecting to, used to inform optimal transactions receipts fetching. Valid options: `alchemy`, `quicknode`, `infura`, `parity`, `nethermind`, `debug_geth`, `erigon`, `basic`, `any`. |

</Steps>

## Generate Addresses

You'll need four addresses and their private keys when setting up the chain:

*   The `Admin` address has the ability to upgrade contracts.
*   The `Batcher` address publishes Sequencer transaction data to L1.
*   The `Proposer` address publishes L2 transaction results (state roots) to L1.
*   The `Sequencer` address signs blocks on the p2p network.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Generate new addresses</h3>}

<Callout type="error">
You should **not** use the `wallets.sh` tool for production deployments.
If you are deploying an OP Stack based chain into production, you should likely be using a combination of hardware security modules and hardware wallets.
</Callout>

```bash
./packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/getting-started/wallets.sh
```

{<h3>Check the output</h3>}

Make sure that you see output that looks something like the following:

```text
Copy the following into your .envrc file:
  
# Admin address
export GS_ADMIN_ADDRESS=0x9625B9aF7C42b4Ab7f2C437dbc4ee749d52E19FC
export GS_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=0xbb93a75f64c57c6f464fd259ea37c2d4694110df57b2e293db8226a502b30a34

# Batcher address
export GS_BATCHER_ADDRESS=0xa1AEF4C07AB21E39c37F05466b872094edcf9cB1
export GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xe4d9cd91a3e53853b7ea0dad275efdb5173666720b1100866fb2d89757ca9c5a
  
# Proposer address
export GS_PROPOSER_ADDRESS=0x40E805e252D0Ee3D587b68736544dEfB419F351b
export GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2d1f265683ebe37d960c67df03a378f79a7859038c6d634a61e40776d561f8a2
  
# Sequencer address
export GS_SEQUENCER_ADDRESS=0xC06566E8Ec6cF81B4B26376880dB620d83d50Dfb
export GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2a0290473f3838dbd083a5e17783e3cc33c905539c0121f9c76614dda8a38dca
```

{<h3>Save the addresses</h3>}

Copy the output from the previous step and paste it into your `.envrc` file as directed.

{<h3>Fund the addresses</h3>}

**You will need to send ETH to the `Admin`, `Proposer`, and `Batcher` addresses.**
The exact amount of ETH required depends on the L1 network being used.
**You do not need to send any ETH to the `Sequencer` address as it does not send transactions.**

It's recommended to fund the addresses with the following amounts when using Sepolia:

*   `Admin` — 0.5 Sepolia ETH
*   `Proposer` — 0.2 Sepolia ETH
*   `Batcher` — 0.1 Sepolia ETH

</Steps>

## Load Environment variables

Now that you've filled out the environment variable file, you need to load those variables into your terminal.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Load the variables with direnv</h3>}

<Callout>
You're about to use `direnv` to load environment variables from the `.envrc` file into your terminal.
Make sure that you've [installed `direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) and that you've properly [hooked `direnv` into your shell](#configuring-direnv).
</Callout>

Next you'll need to allow `direnv` to read this file and load the variables into your terminal using the following command.

```bash
direnv allow
```

<Callout>
WARNING: `direnv` will unload itself whenever your `.envrc` file changes.
**You *must* rerun the following command every time you change the `.envrc` file.**
</Callout>

{<h3>Confirm that the variables were loaded</h3>}

After running `direnv allow` you should see output that looks something like the following (the exact output will vary depending on the variables you've set, don't worry if it doesn't look exactly like this):

```bash
direnv: loading ~/optimism/.envrc                                                            
direnv: export +DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT +ETHERSCAN_API_KEY +GS_ADMIN_ADDRESS +GS_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_BATCHER_ADDRESS +GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_PROPOSER_ADDRESS +GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY +GS_SEQUENCER_ADDRESS +GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY +IMPL_SALT +L1_RPC_KIND +L1_RPC_URL +PRIVATE_KEY +TENDERLY_PROJECT +TENDERLY_USERNAME
```

**If you don't see this output, you likely haven't [properly configured `direnv`](#configuring-direnv).**
Make sure you've configured `direnv` properly and run `direnv allow` again so that you see the desired output.

</Steps>

## Configure your network

Once you've built both repositories, you'll need to head back to the Optimism Monorepo to set up the configuration file for your chain.
Currently, chain configuration lives inside of the [`contracts-bedrock`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock) package in the form of a JSON file.

<Steps>

{<h3>Enter the Optimism Monorepo</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism
```

{<h3>Move into the contracts-bedrock package</h3>}

```bash
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
```

{<h3>Generate the configuration file</h3>}

Run the following script to generate the `getting-started.json` configuration file inside of the `deploy-config` directory.

```bash
./scripts/getting-started/config.sh
```

{<h3>Review the configuration file (Optional)</h3>}

If you'd like, you can review the configuration file that was just generated by opening up `deploy-config/getting-started.json` in your favorite text editor.
It's recommended to keep this file as-is for now so you don't run into any unexpected errors.

</Steps>

## Deploy the Create2 Factory (Optional)

If you're deploying an OP Stack chain to a network other than Sepolia, you may need to deploy a Create2 factory contract to the L1 chain.
This factory contract is used to deploy OP Stack smart contracts in a deterministic fashion.

<Callout>
This step is typically only necessary if you are deploying your OP Stack chain to custom L1 chain.
If you are deploying your OP Stack chain to Sepolia, you can safely skip this step.
</Callout>

<Steps>

{<h3>Check if the factory exists</h3>}

The Create2 factory contract will be deployed at the address `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`.
You can check if this contract has already been deployed to your L1 network with a block explorer or by running the following command:

```bash
cast codesize 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

If the command returns `0` then the contract has not been deployed yet.
If the command returns `69` then the contract has been deployed and you can safely skip this section.

{<h3>Fund the factory deployer</h3>}

You will need to send some ETH to the address that will be used to deploy the factory contract, `0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362`.
This address can only be used to deploy the factory contract and will not be used for anything else.
Send at least 1 ETH to this address on your L1 chain.

{<h3>Deploy the factory</h3>}

Using `cast`, deploy the factory contract to your L1 chain:

```bash
cast publish --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL 0xf8a58085174876e800830186a08080b853604580600e600039806000f350fe7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf31ba02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222a02222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222 
```

{<h3>Wait for the transaction to be mined</h3>}

Make sure that the transaction is included in a block on your L1 chain before continuing.

{<h3>Verify that the factory was deployed</h3>}

Run the code size check again to make sure that the factory was properly deployed:

```bash
cast codesize 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

</Steps>

## Deploy the L1 contracts

Once you've configured your network, it's time to deploy the L1 contracts necessary for the functionality of the chain.

<Steps>

{<h3>Deploy the L1 contracts</h3>}

```bash
forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --private-key $GS_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL --slow
```

<Callout>
If you see a nondescript error that includes `EvmError: Revert` and `Script failed` then you likely need to change the `IMPL_SALT` environment variable.
This variable determines the addresses of various smart contracts that are deployed via [CREATE2](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014).
If the same `IMPL_SALT` is used to deploy the same contracts twice, the second deployment will fail.
**You can generate a new `IMPL_SALT` by running `direnv allow` anywhere in the Optimism Monorepo.**
</Callout>

{<h3>Generate contract artifacts</h3>}

```bash
forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --sig 'sync()' --rpc-url $L1_RPC_URL
```

</Steps>

## Generate the L2 config files

Now that you've set up the L1 smart contracts you can automatically generate several configuration files that are used within the Consensus Client and the Execution Client.

You need to generate three important files:

1.  `genesis.json` includes the genesis state of the chain for the Execution Client.
2.  `rollup.json` includes configuration information for the Consensus Client.
3.  `jwt.txt` is a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction) that allows the Consensus Client and the Execution Client to communicate securely (the same mechanism is used in Ethereum clients).

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the op-node package</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-node
```

{<h3>Create genesis files</h3>}

Now you'll generate the `genesis.json` and `rollup.json` files within the `op-node` folder:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go genesis l2 \
  --deploy-config ../packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/getting-started.json \
  --deployment-dir ../packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/getting-started/ \
  --outfile.l2 genesis.json \
  --outfile.rollup rollup.json \
  --l1-rpc $L1_RPC_URL
```

{<h3>Create an authentication key</h3>}

Next you'll create a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction) that will be used to authenticate the Consensus Client and the Execution Client.
This token is used to ensure that only the Consensus Client and the Execution Client can communicate with each other.
You can generate a JWT with the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

{<h3>Copy genesis files into the op-geth directory</h3>}

Finally, you'll need to copy the `genesis.json` file and `jwt.txt` file into `op-geth` so you can use it to initialize and run `op-geth`:

```bash
cp genesis.json ~/op-geth
cp jwt.txt ~/op-geth
```

</Steps>

## Initialize `op-geth`

You're almost ready to run your chain!
Now you just need to run a few commands to initialize `op-geth`.
You're going to be running a Sequencer node, so you'll need to import the `Sequencer` private key that you generated earlier.
This private key is what your Sequencer will use to sign new blocks.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the op-geth directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/op-geth
```

{<h3>Create a data directory folder</h3>}

```bash
mkdir datadir
```

{<h3>Initialize op-geth</h3>}

```bash
build/bin/geth init --datadir=datadir genesis.json
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-geth`

Now you'll start `op-geth`, your Execution Client.
Note that you won't start seeing any transactions until you start the Consensus Client in the next step.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run `op-geth` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-geth directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/op-geth
```

{<h3>Run op-geth</h3>}

<Callout type="info">
You're using `--gcmode=archive` to run `op-geth` here because this node will act as your Sequencer.
It's useful to run the Sequencer in archive mode because the `op-proposer` requires access to the full state.
Feel free to run other (non-Sequencer) nodes in full mode if you'd like to save disk space.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
It's important that you've already initialized the geth node at this point as per the previous section. Failure to do this will cause startup issues between `op-geth` and `op-node`.
</Callout>

```bash
./build/bin/geth \
  --datadir ./datadir \
  --http \
  --http.corsdomain="*" \
  --http.vhosts="*" \
  --http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --http.api=web3,debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --ws \
  --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --ws.port=8546 \
  --ws.origins="*" \
  --ws.api=debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --syncmode=full \
  --gcmode=archive \
  --nodiscover \
  --maxpeers=0 \
  --networkid=42069 \
  --authrpc.vhosts="*" \
  --authrpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --authrpc.port=8551 \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true
```

</Steps>

## Start `op-node`

Once you've got `op-geth` running you'll need to run `op-node`.
Like Ethereum, the OP Stack has a Consensus Client (`op-node`) and an Execution Client (`op-geth`).
The Consensus Client "drives" the Execution Client over the Engine API.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-node` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-node directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-node
```

{<h3>Run op-node</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-node \
  --l2=http://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --sequencer.enabled \
  --sequencer.l1-confs=5 \
  --verifier.l1-confs=4 \
  --rollup.config=./rollup.json \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=8547 \
  --p2p.disable \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --p2p.sequencer.key=$GS_SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND
```

Once you run this command, you should start seeing the `op-node` begin to sync L2 blocks from the L1 chain.
Once the `op-node` has caught up to the tip of the L1 chain, it'll begin to send blocks to `op-geth` for execution.
At that point, you'll start to see blocks being created inside of `op-geth`.

<Callout type="info">
**By default, your `op-node` will try to use a peer-to-peer to speed up the synchronization process.**
If you're using a chain ID that is also being used by others, like the default chain ID for this tutorial (42069), your `op-node` will receive blocks signed by other sequencers.
These requests will fail and waste time and network resources.
**To avoid this, this tutorial starts with peer-to-peer synchronization disabled (`--p2p.disable`).**

Once you have multiple nodes, you may want to enable peer-to-peer synchronization.
You can add the following options to the `op-node` command to enable peer-to-peer synchronization with specific nodes:

```
  --p2p.static=<nodes> \
  --p2p.listen.ip=0.0.0.0 \
  --p2p.listen.tcp=9003 \
  --p2p.listen.udp=9003 \
```

You can alternatively also remove the [--p2p.static](/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#p2pstatic) option, but you may see failed requests from other chains using the same chain ID.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Start `op-batcher`

The `op-batcher` takes transactions from the Sequencer and publishes those transactions to L1.
Once these Sequencer transactions are included in a finalized L1 block, they're officially part of the canonical chain.
The `op-batcher` is critical!

It's best to give the `Batcher` address at least 1 Sepolia ETH to ensure that it can continue operating without running out of ETH for gas.
Keep an eye on the balance of the `Batcher` address because it can expend ETH quickly if there are a lot of transactions to publish.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-batcher` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-batcher directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-batcher
```

{<h3>Run op-batcher</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-batcher \
  --l2-eth-rpc=http://localhost:8545 \
  --rollup-rpc=http://localhost:8547 \
  --poll-interval=1s \
  --sub-safety-margin=6 \
  --num-confirmations=1 \
  --safe-abort-nonce-too-low-count=3 \
  --resubmission-timeout=30s \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=8548 \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --max-channel-duration=1 \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --private-key=$GS_BATCHER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

<Callout type="info">
The `--max-channel-duration=n` setting tells the batcher to write all the data to L1 every `n` L1 blocks.
When it is low, transactions are written to L1 frequently and other nodes can synchronize from L1 quickly.
When it is high, transactions are written to L1 less frequently and the batcher spends less ETH.
If you want to reduce costs, either set this value to 0 to disable it or increase it to a higher value.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Start `op-proposer`

Now start `op-proposer`, which proposes new state roots.

<Steps>

{<h3>Open up a new terminal</h3>}

You'll need a terminal window to run the `op-proposer` in.

{<h3>Navigate to the op-proposer directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/op-proposer
```

{<h3>Run op-proposer</h3>}

```bash
./bin/op-proposer \
  --poll-interval=12s \
  --rpc.port=8560 \
  --rollup-rpc=http://localhost:8547 \
  --l2oo-address=$(cat ../packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/getting-started/L2OutputOracleProxy.json | jq -r .address) \
  --private-key=$GS_PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --l1-eth-rpc=$L1_RPC_URL
```

</Steps>

## Connect Your Wallet to Your Chain

You now have a fully functioning OP Stack Rollup with a Sequencer node running on `http://localhost:8545`.
You can connect your wallet to this chain the same way you'd connect your wallet to any other EVM chain.
If you need an easy way to connect to your chain, just [click here](https://chainid.link?network=opstack-getting-started).

## Get ETH On Your Chain

Once you've connected your wallet, you'll probably notice that you don't have any ETH to pay for gas on your chain.
The easiest way to deposit Sepolia ETH into your chain is to send ETH directly to the `L1StandardBridge` contract.

<Steps>

{<h3>Navigate to the contracts-bedrock directory</h3>}

```bash
cd ~/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock
```

{<h3>Get the address of the L1StandardBridgeProxy contract</h3>}

```bash
cat deployments/getting-started/L1StandardBridgeProxy.json | jq -r .address
```

{<h3>Send some Sepolia ETH to the L1StandardBridgeProxy contract</h3>}

Grab the L1 bridge proxy contract address and, using the wallet that you want to have ETH on your Rollup, send that address a small amount of ETH on Sepolia (0.1 or less is fine).
This will trigger a deposit that will mint ETH into your wallet on L2.
It may take up to 5 minutes for that ETH to appear in your wallet on L2.

</Steps>

## See Your Rollup in Action

You can interact with your Rollup the same way you'd interact with any other EVM chain.
Send some transactions, deploy some contracts, and see what happens!

## Next Steps

*   You can [modify the blockchain in various ways](../hacks/overview).
*   Check out the [protocol specs](https://specs.optimism.io/) for more detail about the rollup protocol.
