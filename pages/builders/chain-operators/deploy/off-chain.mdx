# OP Stack Off Chain Components

The following information has some best practices around running the OP Stack's
off chain components.

## Best Practices

### Correct Releases Versions

Chain and node operators should always run the latest production releases of
the OP Stack's off chain components. Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs
can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases)
and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases).

*   Production releases are always tags, versioned as
    `<component-name>/v<semver>`. For example, an `op-node` release might be
    versioned as `op-node/v1.7.5`.
*   Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.7.7`, indicate releases of all
    Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
*   In the monorepo, this means these `v<semver>` releases contain all `op-*`
    components, and exclude all `contracts-*` components.
*   `op-geth` embeds upstream geth's version inside it's own version as follows:
    `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`. Basically, geth's version is
    our minor version. For example if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding
    `op-geth` version would be `v1.101200.0`. Note that we pad out to three
    characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch
    version. Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not
    padded.
