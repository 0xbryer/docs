# Bridged USDC Standard on the OP Stack

This explainer provides a high-level overview of the Bridged USDC Standard and how chain operators can deploy it.

## Bridged USDC Standard
Circle introduced the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/blog/bridged-usdc-standard) to ensure that chain operators can easily deploy a form of USDC that is capable of being upgraded in-place by Circle to Native USDC, if and when appropriate, and prevent the fragmentation problem.

Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack allows for an efficient and modular solution for expanding the Bridged USDC Standard across the Superchain ecosystem. Utilizing the cross chain messaging of the canonical OP Stack bridge the adapter allows for easy access to Bridged USDC liquidity across OP Stack chains.


<Callout type="info">
    OP stack chain operators can deploy Bridged USDC Standard at launch, providing immediate USDC availability for their users. 
    Importantly, the Bridged USDC Standard allows for a seamless, in-place upgrade to Native USDC if an agreement is later reached between the chain operator and Circle.

## Security Considerations

*   The Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack has undergone [audits](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/opUSDC/blob/main/audits/spearbit.pdf) and is recommended for production use.
*   While the Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack utilizes the cross domain messenger, governance over the upgradable contract would be managed by the chain operator.

## Next Steps
*   Ready to get started? Read our setup guide on the [Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/opUSDC#setup).
