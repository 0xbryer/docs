# USDC on OP Stack Chains

This explainer provides a high-level overview of USDC implementations on OP Stack, including the types of USDC representations, deployment options, and considerations for chain operators.
It aims to help OP Stack chains operators understand and implement the most suitable USDC strategy for their needs, with a focus on the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle.

## Bridged USDC Standard

The Bridged USDC Standard by Circle provides an efficient and modular solution for expanding the Bridged USDC Standard across the Superchain ecosystem.
It utilizes the cross-chain messaging of the canonical OP Stack bridge, allowing for easy access to Bridged USDC liquidity across OP Stack chains.

  *   Bridged USDC: [USDC.e on OP Mainnet](https://basescan.org/token/0xd9aaec86b65d86f6a7b5b1b0c42ffa531710b6ca), USDbC on Base
  *   Native USDC: [USDC on OP Mainnet](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913), USDC on Base
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    OP stack chain operators can deploy Bridged USDC at launch, providing immediate USDC availability for their users. 
    Importantly, the Bridged USDC Standard allows for a seamless, in-place upgrade to Native USDC if an agreement is later reached between the chain operator and Circle.

## Security Considerations

*   The Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack has undergone [audits](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/opUSDC/blob/main/audits/spearbit.pdf) and is recommended for production use.
*   The Bridged USDC inherits the same security model as the OP Stack chains rollup.
*   While the Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack utilizes the cross domain messenger, governance over the upgradable contract would be owned by the chain operator.

## Next Steps

*   Read the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/blog/bridged-usdc-standard) from Circle.

## FAQs

### Do custom bridges break an OP Stack chains operator's agreement with the law of chains?

No, The language in the law of chains associated with security, uptime, and liveness is only focused on the **StandardBridge** and the rest of the rollup contracts. OP Stack chains operators and developers are free to build custom bridges on top of OP Stack chainss.

### How does the custom bridge work with interop between OP Stack chainss?

The standard utilizes the cross-chain messaging of the canonical OP Stack bridge, allowing for easy access to Bridged USDC liquidity across OP Stack chains.
