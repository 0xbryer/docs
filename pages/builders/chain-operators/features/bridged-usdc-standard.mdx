# USDC on OP Chains

This explainer provides a high-level overview of USDC implementations on OP Stack, including the types of USDC representations, deployment options, and considerations for chain operators.
It aims to help OP Chain operators understand and implement the most suitable USDC strategy for their needs, with a focus on the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle.

## Bridged USDC Standard

The Bridged USDC Standard by Circle provides an efficient and modular solution for expanding the Bridged USDC Standard across the Superchain ecosystem.
It utilizes the cross-chain messaging of the canonical OP Stack bridge, allowing for easy access to Bridged USDC liquidity across OP Stack chains.

## Types of USDC

There are two main types of USDC representations on OP Chains:

1.  **Bridged USDC**: USDC that is bridged from Ethereum (L1) to your OP Chain (L2).
2.  **Native USDC**: USDC that is issued natively on your OP Chain (L2) by Circle and can be moved between chains using the [CCTP protocol contracts](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/cctp-protocol-contract).

Chain operators can use the Bridged USDC Standard to:

1.  Deploy Bridged USDC on the OP Stack chain.
2.  Provide optionality for Circle to seamlessly upgrade Bridged USDC to Native USDC.

## How It Works

OP Chain operators have two main options for implementing USDC:

### Bridged-to-Native Upgrade Path

This option utilizes the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle, allowing for a seamless upgrade from Bridged USDC to Native USDC.

*   Maintains compatibility with the [Law of Chains](https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514).
*   Enables "in-place" upgrade to Native USDC, preserving contract address, user balances, and DeFi integrations.

#### Benefits

*   Reduces the need to migrate liquidity if native USDC is deployed on your chain.
*   Minimizes potential fragmentation from having two types of USDC representations on your OP Chain.

#### Limitations

*   Requires deploying an upgradeable custom bridge that the OP Chain operator custodies (be aware of the security implications)
*   Requires additional work from bridge interface partners and liquidity bridges to index the custom bridge

#### Implementation Steps

1.  Use the `L1OpUSDCFactory` contract to deploy the necessary contracts on L1 and L2.
2.  Set up the `L1OpUSDCBridgeAdapter` and `L2OpUSDCBridgeAdapter`.
3.  Add token metadata to the Superchain Tokenlist using the custom bridge format.

### Standard Bridged USDC Path

This option is suitable for chains that only need Bridged USDC and don't anticipate requiring Native USDC in the near future.

#### Benefits

*   Fastest way to get USDC on an OP Chain
*   Inherits the same security model as the OP Chain rollup

#### Limitations

*   Requires significant migration effort if the chain operator wants to migrate to native USDC
*   Potential fragmentation with having two types of USDC representations on your OP Chain if the chain operator wants to migrate to native USDC

#### Implementation Steps

1.  Deploy the OVM fiat token compatible with the StandardBridge.
2.  Add token metadata to the Superchain Tokenlist using the StandardBridge format


## Considerations for Chain Operators

When deciding which USDC implementation to use, consider the following:

*   Do you anticipate needing Native USDC in the future?
*   Can you allocate resources to implement the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle?
*   Are you prepared to handle the security responsibilities of the chosen implementation?

## Security Considerations

*   The Bridged USDC Standard for the OP Stack has undergone audits and is recommended for production use.
*   The Bridged USDC inherits the same security model as the OP Chain rollup.

## Next Steps

*   Read the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/blog/bridged-usdc-standard) from Circle.
*   For technical details on the deployment and bridging processes, as well as information about important contracts, Read [USDC implementation guide](/builders/chain-operators/features/usdc-implementation-guide) page.

## FAQs

### What is the StandardBridge?

The StandardBridge enables permissionless transferring of ETH and ERC-20 tokens between L1 and L2.

### Can I deploy a [Bridged USDC Standard by Circle](https://www.circle.com/blog/bridged-usdc-standard) using the StandardBridge?

No, the StandardBridge requires the token contract to adhere to the interface specified in [OptimismMintableERC20.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/IOptimismMintableERC20.sol) but the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle requires using the `FiatTokenV2_1` and `FiatTokenProxy`, which does not support the required interface.
In addition, the Bridged USDC Standard by Circle requires the bridge to support additional functionality like the `burnLockedUSDC` on the L1, and transferring ownership to Circle.
The StandardBridge does not support any of this functionality.

### Do custom bridges break an OP Chain operator's agreement with the law of chains?

No, The language in the law of chains associated with security, uptime, and liveness is only focused on the **StandardBridge** and the rest of the rollup contracts. OP Chain operators and developers are free to build custom bridges on top of OP Chains.

### How does the custom bridge work with interop between OP Chains?

The standard utilizes the cross-chain messaging of the canonical OP Stack bridge, allowing for easy access to Bridged USDC liquidity across OP Stack chains.
