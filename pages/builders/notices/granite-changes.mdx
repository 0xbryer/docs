# Preparing for Granite Breaking Changes

This page outlines breaking changes related to the Granite network upgrade for wallets and front-end developers, chain operators, and node operators.
If you experience difficulty at any stage of this process, please reach out to [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).

<Callout type="info">
  The Granite upgrade for OP Sepolia was activated on **[DATE]**.  The Granite OP Mainnet upgrade will be optimistically activated **[DATE]*, pending [governance approval](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).
</Callout>

## What's Included in Granite

The Granite network upgrade includes the following:

*   

## For Wallets and Front-End Developers

The proposed Granite upgrade to the OP Stack and OP Mainnet changes

*
*


### Preparing Your Wallet or Front-End

*
*

## For Chain Operators

The proposed Granite upgrade impacts OP chains and requires chain operators to upgrade their chain and configure the sequencer for Granite.

*

<Steps>

  ### Prepare Sequencer Node

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you are operating an OP Chain that has an entry in the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json), the Granite activation date is part of the `op-node` and `op-geth` nodes, and are using the [--network](/builders/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config#network) and [--op-network](/builders/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#op-network-betaop-network) flags. No action is needed for the sequencer after preparing the `SystemConfig` transaction. 
  </Callout>

  For custom chains not included in the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json), you will need to manually configure the [activation timestamp](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/superchain/configs/mainnet/superchain.toml). You have two configuration options for your sequencer node:

  *   **Option 1:** Set the Granite activation date in your `rollup.json`  config file. You will still need to set the `override.granite` flag in `op-geth` with the UNIX timestamp.
  *   **Option 2:** Alternatively, chain operators can use the override flags to configure your sequencer node by specifying a time in the future when Granite will activate.
      *   Set  `override.granite`  in both `op-node` and `op-geth` to the UNIX timestamp of the block you want to activate the Granite hardfork or corresponding env vars for this.
      *   In general, run `op-node --help` or `op-geth --help` to see flags, their descriptions and environment variables.
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  To verify proper configuration, chain operators should confirm in the startup logs of their `op-node` and `op-geth` that the correct Granite activation timestamps are set.
</Callout>

## For Node Operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to Granite before the activation date. For Sepolia, the op-node release [FIND CORRECT VERSION](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.7.7) and op-geth release [FIND CORRECT VERSION](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101315.2) contain these changes.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the Latest Release

  *   [`op-geth`](FIND_CORRECT_LINK)
  *   [`op-node`](FIND_CORRECT_LINK)

  ### Configure the Granite Activation Date

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you are operating a node for an OP Chain that has an entry in the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json), the Granite activation date is part of the `op-node` and `op-geth` nodes. So, no action is needed for the sequencer after upgrading to the latest release. Please skip to [Step 3: Verify Your Configuration](#verify-your-configuration).
  </Callout>

  For node operators of custom chains not included in the [`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json), you will need to manually configure the [activation timestamp](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/superchain/configs/mainnet/superchain.toml). This can be done one of two ways:

  *   **Option 1:** Set the activation time in the `rollup.json` for `op-node`. You will still need to set the `override.granite` flag in `op-geth` if you use this option.
  *   **Option 2:** Set the activation time via overrides (CLI) in both `op-node` and `op-geth`. These will need to be set on `op-node` and `op-geth` for the sequencer and all other nodes.

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

  *   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
  *   Check that the Granite time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
  *   Check that the Granite time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
</Steps>
