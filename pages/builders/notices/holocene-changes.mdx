# Preparing for Holocene breaking changes

This page outlines breaking changes related to the Holocene network upgrade for chain operators, and node operators.
If you experience difficulty at any stage of this process, please reach out to [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).

<Callout type="info">
The Holocene upgrade for the Sepolia Superchain will be activated at **Tue Nov 26 at 15:00:00 UTC (unix timestamp** `1732633200`).

The Holocene upgrade for the Mainnet Superchain is planned to happen on **Thu 9 Jan 2025 18:00:01 UTC**, [governance proposal link to be added]().
</Callout>

## What's Included in Holocene

Holocene contains two changes:

- **Holocene block derivation**: a set of changes that render the derivation pipeline stricter and simpler, improving worst-case scenarios for Fault Proofs and Interoperability.
- **EIP-1559 configurability**: The elasticity and denominator EIP-1559 parameters become configurable via the `SystemConfig` L1 contract, allowing the gas target and gas limit to be configured independently.

 For more information on the Holocene implementation details, please review [Holocene specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/holocene/overview.html).

## For Chain Operators

Since the Holocene upgrade changes the execution and derivation rules, all chain and node operators, as for all hardforks, have to upgrade their nodes ahead of the activation times to a release that contains the Holocene changes and has the activation times for their chains baked in, or set the activation times manually via overrides, see below.

Besides this, chain operators must upgrade their chainâ€™s `SystemConfig` to the latest OP Contracts [v1.8.0-rc.1 release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.8.0-rc.1). The updated `SystemConfig` implementations are deployed at addresses

- Sepolia: TBD
- Mainnet: TBD

Chain operators need to update their proxy contracts to point to these new implementations. The following upgrade script can be used to facilitate the upgrade: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12878


### For fault proof enabled chains 



## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to a Holocene release before the activation date. For Sepolia, the op-node release [FIND CORRECT VERSION](todo: add link) and op-geth release [FIND CORRECT VERSION](todo: add link) contain these changes.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the latest release

  *   [`op-geth`](FIND_CORRECT_LINK)
  *   [`op-node`](FIND_CORRECT_LINK)

  ### Configure the Holocene activation date

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you are operating a node for an OP Chain that have opted into the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md), the Holocene activation date is part of the `op-node` and `op-geth` nodes. So, no action is needed for the sequencer after upgrading to the latest release. Please skip to [Step 3: Verify Your Configuration](#verify-your-configuration).

    For Sepolia that is: `OP Sepolia`, `Base Sepolia`, `Mode Sepolia`, and `Zora Sepolia`.
  </Callout>

  For node operators of not included in the [hardfork activation inheritance behavior](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md), you will need to manually configure the [activation timestamp](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/superchain/configs/mainnet/superchain.toml). This can be done one of two ways:

  *   **Option 1:** Set the activation time in the `rollup.json` for `op-node`. You will still need to set the `override.granite` flag in `op-geth` if you use this option.
  *   **Option 2:** Set the activation time via overrides (CLI) in both `op-node` and `op-geth`. These will need to be set on `op-node` and `op-geth` for the sequencer and all other nodes.

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

  *   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
  *   Check that the Granite time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
  *   Check that the Granite time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
