## Preparing for Optimism SDK deprecation

The Optimism SDK will officially be deprecated on **\[insert deprecation date]**. We are shifting to the `viem/opstack` library for a more modern, efficient, and flexible development experience. This change affects all tutorials and resources that previously relied on the Optimism SDK, and we have updated relevant documentation accordingly.

### Breaking Changes to Expect

The migration from the Optimism SDK to `viem`/`opstack` brings several breaking changes:

*   **Transaction estimation**: Methods for estimating gas fees will now leverage `viem` APIs.
*   **Bridging**: All token bridging actions must be updated to use the `opstack` bridging methods.
*   **Cross-chain communication**: `opstack` simplifies the cross-domain messaging functionality.
*   **SDK method removal**: All deprecated SDK methods will be unavailable after \[insert deprecation date].

We strongly encourage developers and users to transition to `viem/opstack` before the deprecation date to avoid disruptions.

### Updated Tutorials

The following tutorials have been updated to use `viem/opstack` library:

*   [Estimating Transaction Costs on OP Mainnet](../tutorials/transaction-cost-estimation)\
    Estimation of transaction costs now uses the `viem` gas estimation utilities.

*   [Triggering OP Mainnet Transactions from Ethereum](../tutorials/trigger-op-transactions)\
    Learn how to trigger transactions using `viem` to interact with the OP Mainnet.

*   [Tracing Deposits and Withdrawals](../tutorials/tracing-deposits-withdrawals)\
    The tracing functionalities have been adapted to use `opstack` for efficient results.

*   [Viewing Deposits and Withdrawals by Address](../tutorials/view-deposits-withdrawals)\
    This tutorial outlines updated methods in `viem` for querying deposits and withdrawals by address.

*   [Bridging Your Standard ERC-20 Token Using the Standard Bridge](../tutorials/bridge-standard-erc20)\
    The standard bridge tutorial now uses `opstack` for token transfers between Ethereum and OP Mainnet.

*   [Bridging Your Custom ERC-20 Token Using the Standard Bridge](../tutorials/bridge-custom-erc20)\
    Custom ERC-20 tokens can now be bridged via `opstack`, making the process more streamlined.

*   [Bridging ERC-20 Tokens to OP Mainnet With the Optimism SDK](../tutorials/bridge-sdk-erc20)\
    **Deprecated** – please use [Bridging Your Custom ERC-20 Token Using the Standard Bridge](../tutorials/bridge-custom-erc20).

*   [Bridging ETH to OP Mainnet With the Optimism SDK](../tutorials/bridge-sdk-eth)\
    **Deprecated** – please use [Estimating Transaction Costs on OP Mainnet](../tutorials/transaction-cost-estimation).

*   [Communicating Between OP Mainnet and Ethereum in Solidity](../tutorials/cross-chain-solidity)\
    Cross-chain communication now leverages `opstack` for all messaging.

### For App Developers

If your application currently depends on the Optimism SDK, you will need to migrate to using the `viem/opstack` library. Our tutorials have been updated to reflect these changes, and it is critical to update your applications before the deprecation date to maintain compatibility.

### For Chain Operators

Chain operators utilizing the SDK for cross-chain operations, bridging, or other functions should switch to the `viem/opstack`. The `viem/opstack` library offer more efficient methods to handle these operations.

### For Node Operators

Node operators will need to ensure that any scripts or services relying on the Optimism SDK are updated to use `viem/opstack` library. These updates will help align with future improvements and scalability efforts across the OP Stack.
