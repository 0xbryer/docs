# Node Operator Overview

The Node Operator section of the Optimism Docs is a collection of guides and tutorials to help you run your own OP Mainnet or OP Sepolia nodes.
If you'd like to learn more about how OP Mainnet works under the hood, refer to the [OP Mainnet Getting Started Guide](/chain/getting-started) or the [OP Stack Getting Started Guide](/stack/getting-started).
If you want to get right into running a node, feel free to skip ahead to the [Node Operator Tutorials](#node-operator-tutorials) section.

## Software Releases

It's important to keep your node software up to date to ensure that you won't fall out of sync with other OP Mainnet nodes when there's an upgrade.
Software updates can also include important bug fixes and patches that can help keep your node stable.
Refer to the [Software Releases](/builders/node-operators/releases) page for a detailed look at the latest releases of various Rollup Node and Execution Client implementations.
Notifications about important updates are also posted to the [**@Optimism Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/optimism), and to the [**Node & Protocol Announcements Channel on Telegram**](https://t.me/+caq1Ukfp29c0Mzcx).
