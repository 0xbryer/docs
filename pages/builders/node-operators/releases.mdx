# Node Software Releases

This page lists required versions of the node software and how to stay up to date.

<Callout type="info">
  Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases)
  and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases).

## Required Version by Network

These are the minimal required versions for the `op-node` and `op-geth` by network.

*   Experimental Snap Sync support in trusted environments.
*   Improved shutdown behavior of op-batcher

### Required action

New Features:

*   Full Ecotone/4844/Cancun support.
*   Experimental Snap Sync support in trusted environments.
*   Support for the lyra, mode, & orderly OP chains.

### Required action

Upgrade your `op-geth` software.

### Suggested action

No action required.

## [op-node v1.4.0](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.4.0)

### Description

This is a mandatory release for OP Sepolia & Goerli and upgrading is required before **2023-12-20**.
This includes all features required for the Delta Network Upgrade which will be activating at **1703116800 Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 UTC 2023** for Goerli & at **1703203200 Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 UTC 2023** for Sepolia.

*   Span Batches is added to this version of `op-node` & `op-batcher`. It will automatically activate on the `op-node` with the Delta network upgrade timestamp. It can be activated on the batcher by setting the `--batch-type` flag to `1`.
*   The `--engine-sync` flag is being deprecated.
*   The op-node now supports dencun headers

### Required action

Upgrade your `op-node` software.

### Suggested action

*   Explicitly specify [`--op-network`](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#op-network) with a pre-configured OP Stack network.
*   Set `--rollup.load-protocol-versions` to `true`.
*   Optionally, enabling halting your node on breaking changes by setting `--rollup.halt=major`. This does not shut down your node, but stops syncing once it detects an incompatible protocol version. Your node defaults to not halting, but we recommend setting this to at least major so your node does not produce diverging state.

## [op-node v1.3.2](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.3.2)

### Description

This is a mandatory release for OP Mainnet and upgrading is required before **2024-01-11**. This release activates Canyon on op-mainnet, base-mainnet, pgn-mainnet, and zora-mainnet. It will activate at **Thu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024 (unix timestamp: 1704992401)**.

### Required action
