# Ecotone Network Upgrade

<Callout type="warning">
  The Ecotone testnet network upgrade for OP Goerli activated at **1707238800 Tue Feb 6 17:00:00 UTC 2024**. The Ecotone upgrade for OP Sepolia is not scheduled yet.
</Callout>

The following information is how you can prepare your existing nodes for the Ecotone upgrade. There
is a new Beacon endpoint for `op-node`, because soon after the Ecotone activation, batch
transactions will be sent as 4844 blobs, and blobs can only be retrieved from Beacon nodes.
This means node operators will need access to a [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients#consensus-clients) (i.e. Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, etc.).

<Callout type="info">
  If you're using Lighthouse, make sure to use at least the finalized version `v4.6.0`
  because the latest rc contains a bug in its `blob_sidecars` http endpoint.
</Callout>

## Required Actions (All Nodes)

These steps are necessary for EVERY node operator:
You must upgrade your nodes to the following versions prior to Wed Feb 21 17:00:00 UTC 2024.

1.  Upgrade your `op-geth` to version: [v1.101308.0](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101308.0)
2.  Upgrade your `op-node` to version: [v1.5.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
3.  Set [--l1.beacon / $OP\_NODE\_L1\_BEACON](/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#l1beacon) with the address of your L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use.
4.  Either run your own L1 beacon node like [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/run_a_node.html) or use a third-party beacon node RPC service, like [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth-v1-beacon-genesis).

<Callout type="warning">
  If Ecotone activates and you have not set an l1 beacon value on your `op-node`, your node will crash.
</Callout>

## Configure a Blob Archiver (Archive Nodes)

There are several blob archiver options for archive nodes and new full notes without EL sync. Choose one of the following options:

*   **Option 1:**  Configure a `beacon-archiver`. There is a configurable `beacon-archiver` that will allow nodes to sync blob data that is older than 18 days - after blobs are 18 days old, normal beacon nodes will  "pruned" or remove them. If your node is already in sync with the head of the chain, you won't need to use a `beacon-archiver`.
    *   If you're spinning up a new node, if you load it from a snapshot that's within 18 days (the amount of time until blobs are pruned) you will not need to use a `beacon-archiver`  at all as long as your node does not fall offline for more than 18 days.
    *   If you're running a new node that is syncing more than 18 days (the amount of time until blobs are pruned) after Ecotone launch, then you will need to configure a `beacon-archiver` on the `op-node`.

```shell
--l1.beacon-archiver value                                                      ($OP_NODE_L1_BEACON)
          HTTP Endpoint of a Blob Archiver or an L1 Beacon-node that does not prune blobs 
```

*   **Option 2:** Run your own L1 beacon node like [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/run_a_node.html) and configure it to retain all blobs and use that endpoint here.

```shell
# lighthouse
--prune-blobs=false
```

*   **Option 3:** Run a `blob-archiver`, which functions the same, but is lighter weight: [https://github.com/base-org/blob-archiver](https://github.com/base-org/blob-archiver)

## Verify Your Configuration

You can verify your node is configured correctly with the following:

*   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
*   Check that Ecotone time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node logs
*   Check that Ecotone and Cancun time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth logs
