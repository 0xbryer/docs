# Ecotone Network Upgrade

The following information is how you can prepare your nodes for the Ecotone upgrade. There 
is a new Beacon endpoint for `op-node`, because soon after the Ecotone activation, batch 
transactions will be sent as 4844 blobs, and blobs can only be retrieved from Beacon nodes.

<Callout type="info">
  If you're using Lighthouse, make sure to use at least the finalized version `v4.6.0`
  because the latest rc contains a bug in its `blob_sidecars` http endpoint.
</Callout>

*   Upgrade your `op-geth` to version: [v1.101308.0](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases/tag/v1.101308.0)
*   Upgrade your `op-node` to version: [v1.5.1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
*   Configure [--l1.beacon / $OP_NODE_L1_BEACON](/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#l1beacon) with the address of your L1 Beacon-node HTTP endpoint to use.

### Verifying Your Configuration on OP Goerli

You can verify your node is configured correctly with the following:

*   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
*   Check that Ecotone time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node logs
*   Check that Ecotone and Cancun time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth logs
