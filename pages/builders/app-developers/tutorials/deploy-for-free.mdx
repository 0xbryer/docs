# Deploy Your Contracts for Free on the Superchain

This tutorial walks you through the process of verifying your contracts on the [Superchain Developer Console](https://console.optimism.io) and claiming your deployment rebate.

## Pre-requisities

*   You must have signed up to the Superchain Developer Console before deploying your contract(s)
*   You should have a Coinbase Verification linked with your Superchain Dev Console account

## Launch for free

<Steps>
{<h3>Get your Coinbase Verification</h3>}

If you already have a Coinbase Verification proceed to the next step. Coinbase Verifications leverage the Ethereum Attestation Service to enable the issuance of Coinbase-verified, onchain attestations.

To get your Coinbase Verification go to https://www.coinbase.com/onchain-verify, and click “Get verified”. Login with your Coinbase account and go through the Coinbase Verification flow to get your preferred public key verified. 

{<h3>Link your wallet on the Superchain Dev Console</h3>}

Once you have your Coinbase Verification, go to console.optimism.io and login with your preferred email. Select the account drop down and click “Wallets”. Click “Link wallet”, and follow the connect wallet flow to link your public key that has a Coinbase Verification to associate your public key with your Superchain Developer Console login.

{<h3>Verify your contracts on the Superchain Dev Console</h3>}

Once you have linked your wallet to the Superchain Dev Console, go to console.optimism.io and click the banner for “Launch anywhere on the Superchain for free”. On the contracts section, add your contract address, deployment transaction hash, deployer address, and select the chain you deployed on. 

Click verify, and proceed with proving ownership of the contract deployment.

{<h3>Claim your deployment rebates on the Superchain Dev Console</h3>}

*Note*: For this first iteration the rebate will be claimed on OP Mainnet but in the future we will enable the rebate to be claimed on any chain in the Superchain. 

At this point your contract should successfully have been added to your Superchain Dev Console account and if eligible you can claim your deployment rebate. To proceed click “Eligible for rebate”. To complete claiming your deployment rebate, Click “Claim rebate”.
