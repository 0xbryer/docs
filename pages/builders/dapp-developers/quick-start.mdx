# Superchain App Quick Start

This quick start guide walks you through an easy two-step process to deploy an app to any OP Chain â€“ in under 15 minutes. It covers the setup process and links to more detailed documentation articles, so you can dive a bit deeper when needed.

## Step 1: Get Testnet ETH from Superchain Faucet

You'll need some testnet ETH on OP Sepolia to pay for the [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) associated with deploying your test application.
Use the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) to get some free ETH on OP Sepolia for multiple OP Chains with just one click.
You can request testnet ETH from the Superchain Faucet in one of two ways: **connect a wallet** or **login with Github**.

If you **connect a wallet**, you can get up to 1 testnet ETH per network every 24 hours. If you **login with Github**, you can get up to 0.05 testnet ETH per day.

  Looking for more faucets?
  You can also try using [other available OP Sepolia faucets](/builders/tools/build/faucets).
</Callout>

Now you have testnet ETH for several OP Chains! You can use these to deploy and play with testnet apps on chains like Base, Zora, and Mode. For this quick start, we're going to use it to deploy a basic app on OP Mainnet.

## Step 2: Build a Basic App with the Starter Kit

The [Optimism Starter Kit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter) helps you quickly deploy an app to any OP Chain. It runs [viem](https://viem.sh/) under the hood (a lightweight alternative to ethers.js and web3.js for interacting with Ethereum) and automatically verifies and publishes contract code to the block explorer for you.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install the following items to get started:

*   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*   [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

<Steps>
  {<h3>Get an Etherscan key</h3>}

  *   Register for [Etherscan on Optimism](https://explorer.optimism.io/register). This account is different from your normal Etherscan account.
  *   Go to the [API keys page](https://explorer.optimism.io/myapikey) and click **Add** to create a new API key.

  {<h3>Set up the Environment</h3>}

  You will first need to set up your `.env` to tell Forge where to deploy your contract.

  1.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

      ```sh
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

  2.  Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables.

      *   `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Your Etherscan API Key.

      *   `FORGE_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the network to which you deploy.
          If you use [Alchemy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/ecosystem/alchemy), your URL will look like this: `https://opt-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/<Alchemy API Key>`

      *   `FORGE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the wallet you want to deploy from.

      *   `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: WalletConnect v2 requires a project ID. You can obtain it from your WC dashboard: [https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web/web3wallet/installation#obtain-project-id)

  {<h3>Start the application</h3>}

  1.  Clone/fork the optimism-starter repo

      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter.git
      ```

  2.  Install the necessary node packages:

      ```sh
      cd optimism-starter
      npm install
      ```

  3.  Start the frontend with `npm run dev`

      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```

      If you get errors during this step, you might need to [update your Foundry to the latest version](#install-foundry).

  4.  Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

      Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/App.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.

  {<h3>Generate ABIs & React Hooks</h3>}

  This project comes with `@wagmi/cli` built in, which means you can generate wagmi-compatible (type safe) ABIs & React Hooks straight from the command line.

  To generate ABIs & React Hooks from your Foundry project (in `./contracts`), you can run:

  ```sh
  npm run wagmi
  ```

  This will use the wagmi config (`wagmi.config.ts`) to generate a `src/generated.ts` file which will include your ABIs & Hooks that you can start using in your project.

  [Here is an example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/src/components/Attestoooooor.tsx#L77) of Hooks from the generated file being used.

  {<h3>Deploy Your Contracts</h3>}

  To deploy your contracts to a network, you can use Foundry's [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) â€“ a command line tool to tests, build, and deploy your smart contracts.

  You can read a more in-depth guide on using Forge to deploy a smart contract [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying), but we have included a simple script in the `package.json` to get you started.

  To deploy a smart contract to Ethereum Mainnet using Forge, run:

  ```sh
  npm run deploy
  ```
</Steps>

Congratulations! You now have an OP Mainnet app ready for development, which can also be deployed to more OP Chains! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

*   Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/README.md#developing-with-anvil-optimism-mainnet-fork) if you'd like to develop using Anvil, for an Optimism Mainnet Fork.
*   If you're looking to build your app using alternatives such as NEXT.js or a burner wallet, then [check out this resource](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter/blob/main/README.md#alternatives).
*   Visit the [dapp developer tutorials](overview#tutorials) for guides on how to add bridging, wallet features, and L1-to-L2 transactions.
