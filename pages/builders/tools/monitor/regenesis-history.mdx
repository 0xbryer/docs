# Accessing Pre-Regenesis History

This tutorial explains how to access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using the Etherscan CSV exporting tool.
Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain and do not appear on [Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io/).

## Etherscan access

<Steps>
  ### Browse to the [Optimism Explorer](https://explorer.optimism.io/exportDataMain).

  ### Select your address and the type of report you want.

</Steps>

## Dune access

If none of the Etherscan CSV files contains the information you need, you can use a query on [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com), similar to [this query](https://dune.com/queries/354886?addr=%5Cx25E1c58040f27ECF20BBd4ca83a09290326896B3).
You have to log on with a Dune account, but their free tier is sufficient.

<Steps>
  ### Browse to the [OVM1.0 User Address Transactions](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/OVM1.0-User-Address-Transactions) Dashboard on Dune.

  ### Enter the address you wish to search in the `Address` text box in the top left.

  ### Run the query (This requires log in. A free Dune account is sufficient).
</Steps>

Alternatively, to run custom queries in Dune, you can use the `optimism_legacy_ovm1` schema defined in [Dune Docs here](https://dune.com/docs/data-tables/?h=ovm#optimism).
