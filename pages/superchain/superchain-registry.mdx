# The Superchain Registry

The Superchain Registry is a human-readable index of chains which serves as the source of truth for who’s in the Superchain and what modifications they’ve made. The Superchain Registry introduces:

- Clear definition of what constitutes a Standard Chain and config
- A step-by-step process new chains can follow to join the registry
- Validation checks to ensure chains follow the standard config before joining the Superchain Registry
- A Superchain Registry repository that shows who’s in the registry and what changes they have made to the standard config

You can find the [Superchain Registry here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry)

## The Standard Config

The Standard Config is the set of requirements for an OP Stack chain to be considered a Standard Chain within the Superchain. These requirements are currently a draft, pending governance approval.

All chains must meet this config to meet the inclusion requirements for The Superchain. This config isn't meant to exclude chains, but instead make it easier to understand *how* to configure your chain to make it compatatible with the Superchain.

You can find the current draft version of The Standard Config in the [specs repo](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html#op-stack-configurability).

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend using the [OP Contract Manager](/stack/opcm) to deploy L1 contracts that meet the Standard Config.

## Joining the registry

The Superchain Registry is designed to outline and clarify the process for making your chain Superchain-compatible and joining the registry.

If your chain meets the Standard Config requirements, [follow the steps in this guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/add-chain.md) to submit a pull request and join the Superchain.
