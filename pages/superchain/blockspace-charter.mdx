# The Blockspace and Standard Rollup charters

Blockspace Charters and Standard Rollup Charter provide the essential technical and governance framework for the Superchain ecosystem. These frameworks provide a secure and scalable foundation for all stakeholders. By adhering to these charters, chain operators and users can operate confidently within the Optimism Superchain.

These documents establish standards to ensure security, transparency, and long-term sustainability. This guide offers an overview of each charter, explains how chains can achieve compliance to be considered Standard Chains, and how the charters tie into the Superchain Registry.

This doc mostly covers the charters, but references the Superchain Registry as they are all deeply connected. Read more about the Superchain Registry [here](./superchain-registry).

## Summary of charters

The components work in unison to form a cohesive governance and technical framework:

*   **Blockspace Charters:** A type of framework that establishes criteria, governing policies, and precommitments for blockspace in the Optimism ecosystem, ensuring security, uptime, and alignment with the [Law of Chains](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md).
*   **Standard Rollup Charter:** Defines the technical and governance requirements for chains to achieve "Standard" status, ensuring consistency, high security, and operational reliability. Building on Blockspace Charters, this document sets specific technical and operational requirements for "Standard" status. It determines which chains can be added to the Superchain Registry by outlining both on-chain and off-chain validation processes.
*   **Superchain Registry:** The Superchain Registry is a human-readable index of chains which serves as the source of truth for who's in the Superchain and what modifications they've made. Acting as the chain validator, the registry confirms compliance with the Standard Rollup Charter. Chains listed here are officially recognized as "Standard," meeting all governance and technical benchmarks.

Together, these components ensure a robust, scalable, and transparent ecosystem. Blockspace Charters provides the vision and principles, the Standard Rollup Charter translates these into concrete requirements, and the Superchain Registry certifies compliance.

## Blockspace Charters

Blockspace Charters outline the foundational framework for governing blockspace within the Optimism ecosystem. They are structured around three main components, detailed below:

### Criteria

The technical parameters defining which chains are subject to the charter include:

*   **Version:** The OP Stack version powering the chain, validated via commit-hash or release tag.
*   **Configuration:** Parameter bounds for deployment, covering both static variables like Chain ID and dynamic variables such as sequencer roles or upgrade keys.
*   **Solvency:** Verification that the chain's history is free from invalid withdrawals or outputs that could undercollateralize the bridge.

### Governing policies

These establish rules and procedures for stakeholder interactions and blockspace management. For example:

*   Expected behaviors for roles like sequencers and upgrade key holders.
*   Processes for identifying and resolving violations, such as governance votes for removing non-compliant actors.
*   Alignment with the [Law of Chains](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md), ensuring protections like censorship resistance and security.

### Precommitments

Commitments outlining long-term governance stability and anticipated changes. Examples include:

*   Future updates to fee models or role separations.
*   Guidance for evolving technical parameters like gas limits and fee margins.

By defining these components, blockspace charters ensures secure, scalable, and governed blockspace while fostering trust and alignment within the ecosystem.

## The Standard Rollup Charter

The Standard Rollup Charter is a specific blockspace charter, which are a type of framework defining high-level principles, criteria, and governance policies for managing blockspace. The Standard Rollup Charter defines these into actionable requirements for achieving "Standard" status. It ensures that chains adhere to the technical and operational benchmarks necessary to maintain security, compatibility, and compliance with the overarching ecosystem governance.

The Standard Rollup Charter defines the criteria for chains aspiring to achieve "Standard" status. These criteria ensure compatibility, security, and operational consistency. Key elements include:

*   **Security and integrity:** Chains must implement robust security measures to protect against attacks and ensure operational stability. Deterministic configurations and rigorous validations are key components.
*   **Uptime and accessibility:** Chains are required to meet stringent uptime and liveness criteria, guaranteeing uninterrupted access. For instance, periodic performance checks and reliable failure recovery systems are mandated.

Learn more about The Standard Charter in [the governance post](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/feat/standard-rollup-charter/Standard%20Rollup%20Charter.md#standard-rollup-charter).

Here are some specific criteria a chain must meet:

### On-chain criteria

*   **Version validation:** Chains must deploy a governance-approved OP Stack release. Contracts must match the [standard bytecode](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/validation/standard/standard-versions-mainnet.toml).
*   **Configuration checks:** Chain parameters, such as block time and gas metering, must comply with governance-approved specifications. Administrative roles must align with Security Council requirements.

### Off-chain criteria

The Optimism Foundation performs off-chain checks to verify compliance. These include:

*   Ensuring unique Chain IDs.
*   Monitoring security configurations.
*   Verifying governance authenticity.

Such measures remain under the Foundation's oversight until governance transitions to fully autonomous control.

### History integrity

The history integrity check identifies discrepancies in chain history. While this process is expected to be phased out, it ensures chains meet the Law of Chains criteria during their transition to "Standard" status.

### Understanding chain compliance

Chains must meet strict requirements to qualify as "Standard." Below are answers to common questions:

*   **Can I modify system smart contracts and remain Standard?** No, modifications invalidate compliance.
*   **Is a custom gas token chain Standard?** No, chains must use standard gas configurations.
*   **Is an alt-DA mode chain Standard?** No, Standard Rollups must adhere to the default data availability model.
*   **Will beta features qualify as Standard?** Not initially. Features require governance approval and testing.

## The Superchain Registry

The Superchain Registry serves as the authoritative compliance tool. It:

*   **Validates version and configuration:** Ensures chains align with governance-approved standards in the form the The Standard Charter.
*   **Indicates promotion:** Certifies chains meet the standard criteria and promotes them to "Standard".

By integrating with the Standard Rollup Charter, the registry offers an automated and transparent validation system. This ensures chains can independently demonstrate compliance. For additional details, refer to the [Superchain Registry documentation](./superchain-registry).
