## Individual Identity

In the Optimism Collective, individuals are represented by their unique identifier generated via the **[Farcaster protocol id registry](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-registry)**. To register a new user id, you can use the **[Farcaster Id Gateway](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway)**. Most new users register their id via the Warpcast app, which creates a new custody address for users and acts as a wallet.

Attestations can be made about individuals by leaving the recipient address blank and entering the userâ€™s id into the attestation metadata.

You can read more about individual identity in **[the governance docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/project-and-individual-identity-in-the-collective/#building-a-digital-identity)**.
