## Projects

Within the Optimism Collective, [the project entity](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/project-and-individual-identity-in-the-collective/#people) represents contributions to the Optimism Collective and can be used to apply for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).

The project entity is represented onchain by an attestation. The attestation UID is the projectâ€™s unique identifier for its lifecycle in the Collective. To create a new project, an attestation is issued using **[the project schema](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0x7ae9f4adabd9214049df72f58eceffc48c4a69e920882f5b06a6c69a3157e5bd)**. The only metadata included in the project schema is the Farcaster Id of the person who created the project. 

All other project metadata is stored or referenced in the **[Project Metadata Attestation](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe035e3fe27a64c8d7291ae54c6e85676addcbc2d179224fe7fc1f7f05a8c6eac)**. The Project Metadata Attestation is re-issued anytime there is a change in metadata. Apps displaying project metadata should look to the most recent attestation for the up-to-date metadata.
